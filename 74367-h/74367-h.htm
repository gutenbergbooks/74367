<h2 class="nobreak">THE VOICE AND VOCAL MUSIC</h2>
</div>




<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>All the Arts, being emanations from the superman,
are of the highest significance to the human race therapeutically—the
word being used in its broadest possible
significance. They are curative, they do us good. There
is happily no longer a ban put upon any one of them
in the modern world, except by an occasional religious
sect, and even those survivors of a prohibitory past are
rapidly disappearing.</p>

<p>Enough can scarcely be said of the value of the literature
of song as it exists to-day. Whatever has been
written or is yet to appear, is a natural growth, and
should be recognized as welling up from the unsounded
depths of the human mind, as something to be used for
the benefit, here and now, of young and old, male and
female, rich and poor, well and ill—as a fruit ‘for the
healing of the nations.’ When performed under proper
circumstances, music—and particularly song, because it
is so individual—has a power for good that is amazing.
But this is not generally recognized; only by poets and
dreamers has it been stated. The words of such are
accepted by the world at large as beautiful generalizations,
having no immediate or personal significance, applicable
to some realm of fancy, some Celtic fairyland,
as impossible as an Oriental heaven, but not to the
sombre facts of existence upon this earth—facts so discordant
that none but a prophet could by any stretch
of the imagination reconcile them with a life of harmony
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
here. Personally I believe in the foresight of the
prophets and poets, and hope that Science will ere long
come forward to set the seal of authority upon their
utterances. When this is done, song will be accorded
the position that so justly belongs to it, and its place will
not be an inferior one in the scheme of man’s development
through savagery into civilization, and beyond.
The seers spoke better than we know; they saw, and do
see, through the veil of the present into the beyond,
through the paradoxical Paradise of parable into the
theoretical perfection in which the effort to attain practical
results will be one of the chiefest of joys. Is it not
wonderful to realize that music and song are so prominent
in the utterances of these hitherto misunderstood
soothsayers? <em>Truth</em>-sayers are they in sooth!</p>

<p>There is a noble work to be done in the endeavor to
bring about sensibly, systematically and scientifically,
the realization of their visions as they pertain to music,
and a recognition of the value of song and singing and
the application of this beautiful and all but universal
gift to the betterment of conditions both personal and
social.</p>

<p>To the musical enthusiast society seems to be divided
into two classes: those who are musical and those who
are not. The fact remains, however, that every normal
person is musical to a certain degree, though some may
believe it of themselves more readily than others believe
it of them. To paraphrase Shakespeare, some are
born musical, some achieve music, but all should have
music thrust upon them. In one way or another, everyone
should be educated in music, to the degree at least
of knowing from childhood about it and its makers,
being able to participate in musical performance, or at
least to appreciate the performance of others, for the
musical gift is a fundamental part of human nature;
but unfortunately the vast majority of people seem to be
unaware of the importance and value of this precious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
possession, which has indeed by too many come to be
considered as a mere source of amusement, and not
as a thing to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>We have now reached a period when all music, and
particularly singing, should receive most careful consideration.
The voice is so intimate a thing that no one
can avoid it in himself or escape it in others, and so
great is its power when properly used, whether in
speech or song, that it is amazing that its qualities are
not more fully realized by all educators and treated
accordingly. But up to the present time it seems that
those who have influence in educational matters have
not had their eyes opened to the fact that every human
being should be taught to speak properly and to sing as
well as may be, and that these things are perfectly
easy of accomplishment, if only correct models are put
before children as they grow up. Languages, the most
difficult to acquire by adults, are learned by children
with perfect ease from those with whom they come into
contact; they will speak them well or ill, according as
they have heard others speak. In short, example is,
where voice is concerned, better than precept; and the
ear, so intimately associated with everything vocal,
should be given more to do than has hitherto been considered
necessary either in schools or by private teachers.
While most young people do not begin to take
singing lessons until their voices are reasonably settled
and can bear the strain of study, it does not seem incompatible
with the dictates of common sense to say
that the training of voices, as of bodies and minds, may
be undertaken much earlier than has generally been
thought advisable. ‘The precious morning hours’ of
youth are too often shamefully wasted; in them this
natural and beautiful gift should be brought out. Vocal
music should be learned by ear as well as by eye, pieces
suited to varying vocal capacities and wisely selected by
those competent to choose should be taught, while certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
of the musical masterpieces should be made familiar
to all.</p>

<p>This seems so obvious as to be hardly worth saying,
but as a matter of fact, song is by too many looked
upon merely as a luxury to be enjoyed by the few,
whereas it is in reality a necessity that should be used
by all, for all have not only a latent impulse toward
vocal expression, but much more of a natural gift than
is usually granted. Persons selected for the purity
of their enunciation and beauty of their voices should
every day, in all schools, speak and sing to the pupils,
who in turn would unconsciously imitate what they
heard; and so there would grow a regard for purity
and beauty of tone, both in speech and in song, which
later would find expression in the study of the various
branches of vocal music—from folk-song to the art-song,
from sacred music and oratorio to opera. Only
those especially gifted should be permitted by their
masters to take up the profession of singer or teacher
of singing, and thus there would be selected from the
great field of those who know much the few specialists
in this or that phase of the art who know more, and
who are by nature better fitted to exercise their talents
in public.</p>

<p>So many people are able to sing after a fashion that
sufficient care is not always taken to separate those
who are entitled to enter with joy into the ranks of
the interpreters of song from those who are fit only for
the comparative outer darkness of the auditor. But if
that be darkness, how great is the light of those who,
by common consent, are adjudged competent to bear so
glorious a lamp before the footsteps of the world!</p>

<p>The desire to sing is so universal that many enthusiasts
overlook the fact that they have neglected to train
their vocal apparatus until it is too late to make serious
study worth while. Little can then be done beyond
what will give pleasure to the individual himself. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
this universal desire to sing should be universally
recognized. When in future it shall be not only so
recognized but sensibly and scientifically satisfied, then
it will no doubt be found that very great benefit will
result to musical art and, through it, to the daily lives
of well-nigh everyone on earth.</p>

<p>When the science of education shall have advanced
further, music, and especially singing, will hold a very
important place in the scheme, and the difference will
become clearly apparent between the average normal
being with the average vocal equipment and the artist
to the manner born. As with those whose trend toward
mathematics or languages is unmistakable, so the truly
musical are to be distinguished with ease from their
fellows; but all such, and especially singers, should be
educated with great care and in a broad and comprehensive
manner.</p>

<p>Great geniuses have written music to the words of
great poets because they were compelled by the inmost
needs of their natures to supplement the message
of poetry by that of music. What does the world at
large care for these things? Only the educated in musical
art know that they exist, but the time is now at hand
when the storehouses of music will be opened, and
their treasures disseminated among the general public
through the schools. Instrumental music is so costly
in comparison to vocal music that the obvious course
to pursue is to train that wonderful instrument, the
voice, which all carry about with them, but the value
of which is realized by only a few.</p>

<p>The many-sided occupation of the singer should be
as carefully studied as that of the pianist, the violinist,
or the organist. The vocalist requires a technique comparable
to that of any of these virtuosi, a memory
trained to answer the demands not only of music but
of words, a knowledge not merely of one’s own but of
several other languages, a training in the manner of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
speaking and singing intelligibly in these tongues, a
mastery of the actor’s art with all that it means in gesture,
deportment and expression, and, finally, a comprehension
of the whole of vocal literature. Would-be
singers should be well educated men and women,
subjected to rigorous examination in all branches of
their art at every stage of progress; for only thus may
vocal artists be prepared for their exacting and important
career and be made worthy to tread in future our
concert platforms and operatic stages. For this way
singing will become a dignified profession instead of a
spurious and uncertain career, at which the vast majority
of those who follow it can expect to earn but a
pittance.</p>

<p>The fact should be very clearly forced home upon
students that voice alone does not make a public singer
any more than the possession of a Stradivarius makes
a violinist, but if either has a good instrument the possessor
of so valuable a thing should train himself to play
upon it with more than ordinary care, and intelligently
study not only the classics of his branch of the profession,
but, in the case of a singer especially, enlarge his
knowledge of poetry, literature, the drama, and the fine
arts in general. Thus equipped he may with safety and
with reasonable expectations of success take the hazardous
path that leads to the supreme honor of lasting
public esteem. Every student should recognize this
necessity and work with this end in view. The way is
long and the task is hard, but it is not impossible.</p>

<p>Ignorance and daring have long gone hand in hand
with an assurance which is at times amazing, but the
rising generation should be obliged to learn not only
how to sing, but what to sing—both equally important.
And then, with intelligence awakened, and the dawn of
a new day breaking in through the windows of the
mind, we may look for the beginnings of an interest in
the advancement of a vocal art that has too long been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
harnessed to the car of Fashion, and under the yoke of
Commercialism.</p>

<p>As before the Renaissance of plastic art all had been
said in painting and sculpture that could be said in the
old formulæ, so in music the few notes of the scale
had in the hands of the older masters been worked
to their ultimate possibilities of expression, when lo! a
new light was shed upon the situation, and presently
the flood-gates of sound were opened, and undreamed-of
works appeared in rapid succession to amaze and
affright the senses. Song reflects this, and the limits of
vocal capacity have seemingly been reached. It is not
to be believed, however, that, to whatever lengths this
new musical Renaissance may go, the appeal of simple
melody will ever want for an audience. The past has
enough and to spare of song that we have not even
tasted, much less digested. Let us set ourselves to teach
the multitudes of the uninitiated rising generation all
the beauties of the classics of song. They are as full as
ever of worth and loveliness, and must form a part of
the heritage of the generations yet unborn. The peasant
from afar has in him the blood of the peoples from
which sprang the great artists and musicians of the
past, and it is not for a moment to be supposed that
under the freer circumstances of life in America works
of originality and charm will soon be forthcoming.
This is no place nor time for the sadness of a conquered
race that by the waters of another land hung up its
harps, and refused to sing the songs of home. Here, on
the contrary, may all the accumulated wealth of the
beauty of song be joyously revealed to the people by the
people, and for the people’s good.</p>

<p>No words can describe music. Talk of it as we may,
only music can tell us of itself. How profound its appeal
to the very essence of human nature! In the works
that have been left to us we have a marvellous heritage.
Let it not be neglected, but preserved, honored, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
taught to all, from the least even unto the greatest;
for when sound has been wedded to words by one of the
anointed hierarchy of the priests of music, what a mystic
union is there. How potent the spell of a voice lifted
in song informed by the spirit of poetry!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span></p>

<p>We have here at hand that which makes our Paradise—the
gift of song. Let us no longer disregard this
fundamental possession, but use it well, and with it
enter into the peace that song can give to all who have
ears to hear its wondrous message. It is the Evangel
that has for so long been knocking at our doors. Let
us open wide and welcome this friend and comrade
whose voice goes throbbing through the aisles of the
vast Temple of Music—that structure not made with
hands; heard, not seen, present only to the spirit of
mortals, place of worship and refreshment for all generations.</p>

<small>THE VOCAL ORGANS, THEIR OPERATION AND HYGIENE</small></h2>

<p>The vocal instrument; anatomy of the vocal organs; the healthy mechanism—The
larynx; the laryngoscope; operations of the laryngeal muscles—Tone
production; the resonating cavities; vowel formation; articulation—Vocal
hygiene; incorrect tone production; throat stiffness and its cure.</p>


<p>An acquaintance with the anatomical structure of
the vocal organs, together with an understanding of
the acoustic laws bearing on their operations, is usually
held necessary to a competent knowledge of the
principles of voice culture. A rather tedious course of
study is indeed demanded for this purpose. But it will
be our aim to present this portion of our subject briefly,
touching only on those points which are essential to a
practical grasp of vocal methods. For a more extended
treatment of the anatomy of the organs of voice
and breathing any standard text-book of anatomy may
be consulted. It is, however, hoped that our outline
of the subject will suffice for the purposes of the general
reader.</p>

<p>As the subject of acoustics is dealt with in Vol. XII,
the present chapter does not cover this topic. A sufficient
understanding of the laws of vibration and resonance
is also assumed on the part of the reader.</p>

<p>No man-made musical instrument can compare with
the human voice in complexity and delicacy of structure.
Yet, so far as the general principles of its construction
are concerned, it does not differ materially
from the voices of air-breathing mammals and birds
in general. In each case the vocal organs form a complex
wind instrument, consisting of an air chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
(the lungs), a vibrating mechanism (the vocal
cords), and a set of reinforcing resonance cavities.
The human voice differs from the voices of other air-breathing
animals only in its vastly higher development
and complexity.</p>

<p>The vocal organs of all the various species of animal
life we are now considering were developed as a
part of the respiratory system. In the early stages of
the evolution of air-breathing animal forms the lungs
had only one function, that of supplying air for the
oxidizing of the red corpuscles of the blood. No
other use was made of the respiratory organs; the
breath served no purpose beyond that of furnishing
oxygen for the needs of the circulatory system. This
was the condition of those forms which were the forerunners
of present mammal and bird life. In the
course of evolution a gradual change took place in a
part of the respiratory tract. This modification was
an example of what is called in evolutionary science
‘adaptive change.’ The organs of respiration were
modified and developed in such a way that the pressure
of the expired air could be utilized in the production
of sound.</p>

<p>As evolution progressed the organs of voice which
thus had their origin took on an ever-increasing complexity
of structure. This process of evolution has
reached its highest development in man. As a musical
instrument the human vocal organs may fairly be said
to have reached the point of perfection.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>From the anatomist’s standpoint the vocal organs
consist of four parts:</p>

<p>1. The lungs, together with the bones by which they
are inclosed and the muscles which fill and empty
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>2. The larynx and its appendages.</p>

<p>3. The resonating cavities—trachea, pharynx,
mouth, and the cavities of the nose and head.</p>

<p>4. The organs of articulation—the tongue, lips,
teeth, etc.</p>

<p>Each of these organs performs a different function
in the production of useful and beautiful sounds. It
is the generally accepted view among vocal scientists
that each portion of the vocal mechanism has one and
only one correct mode of operation. Many forms of
incorrect action are also possible; indeed, the untrained
voice is believed to be liable in almost every
case to faulty operation in some respect. Scientific
investigation of the voice has for its purpose the determining
of the correct muscular actions of the various
parts of the vocal mechanism, and the formulation
of exercises whereby the student is enabled to
acquire command of these actions.</p>

<p>Modern methods of voice culture embody the results
of scientific study of the vocal mechanism. It must
be observed that not all investigators are agreed upon
what constitutes the correct vocal action. Several conflicting
theories have been urged concerning the proper
movements of the breathing and laryngeal muscles
and the operations of the resonating cavities. An exhaustive
treatment of these various theories is, however,
not called for here. Some of them have been
discarded, others have but few followers. The majority
of authorities are in fair agreement concerning
the theoretical basis of voice culture. In the present
chapter only the theoretical aspect of the subject will
be considered; the third chapter will be devoted to the
practical methods which embody the doctrines of vocal
science.</p>

<p>Two opposed sets of muscles are concerned in the
operations of breathing, those which, respectively, fill
and empty the lungs. The action of inspiration consists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
of an expansion of the chest cavity, which by increasing
its cubical capacity draws in air from the
outside to fill what would otherwise be a vacuum. The
chest cavity is conical in shape, its base being formed
by the diaphragm, and its sides and apex by the ribs,
the breast-bone, and the intercostal muscles.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, there are two distinct forms of
muscular action by which the chest cavity can be expanded
in inspiration: one is the sinking of the base
of the chest cavity, the other the broadening of the
chest by raising the ribs. Either of these can with
some little practice be performed independently of the
other.</p>

<p>The sinking of the base of the cavity is accomplished
by the contraction of the diaphragm. This muscle is
roughly circular in outline. In its relaxed state it rises
to a dome in the middle and might be compared in
shape to an inverted bowl. As it contracts the diaphragm
flattens out and increases the length of the
vertical axis of the chest cavity. In its descent it
pushes the viscera downward and forces the abdomen
to protrude slightly. This manner of breathing is
commonly called abdominal, although the muscles of
the abdomen are not directly concerned in the filling
of the lungs.</p>

<p>The expansion of the chest cavity may be accomplished
by the raising of the ribs. Owing to their
curved shape and sloping position, a slight elevation
of the ribs causes them to rotate outward from the
central axis of the chest cavity. This increases the
horizontal diameter of the cavity in every direction—forward,
backward, and sidewise.</p>

<p>In the judgment of the most competent investigators
the best form of breathing combines the two muscular
actions just described. At the start of the inspiration
the diaphragm descends, but the protruding of the
abdomen is checked almost instantly by a contraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
of the abdominal muscles. The inspiration is then
completed by the lateral expansion of the chest. In
this manner the lungs are filled to their greatest capacity
in the least possible time. Another great advantage
of this type of breathing is that it imparts a
peculiarly erect and graceful carriage, a matter of
much importance to the singer and public speaker.</p>

<p>In the action of expiration following the taking of
a full breath in the manner just described two sets
of muscles are involved. These are: first, the abdominal
muscles, which push the diaphragm back to
its original position; second, the muscles which lower
the ribs (the internal intercostals and some of the
external abdominal muscles). The actions of both
these sets of muscles can easily be observed. When
correctly performed the two actions are simultaneous,
the whole chest cavity being gradually and uniformly
contracted.</p>

<p>A highly important feature of correct breathing, in
the opinion of most authorities, is the control of the
expiration. In the first place, all the expired air must
be converted into tone and none of it allowed to escape
unused. Further, the vocal cords must not be
exposed to the full force of a powerful expiratory
blast, as they are too small and weak to withstand
this pressure without strain and injury. The air must
be fed to the vocal cords in just sufficient quantity to
serve the purposes of tone production.</p>

<p>It is generally held that this economy of breath can
be secured, without strain on the vocal cords, only by
opposing the action of the inspiratory muscles to the
action of the muscles of expiration. Instead of allowing
the inspiratory muscles to relax completely at the
beginning of the expiration these muscles are to be
held on tension throughout the expiration. By this
means both the force and the speed of the expiration
can be regulated at will; no undue pressure is exerted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
on the vocal cords, and the tone is prolonged steadily
and evenly so long as the expiration lasts.</p>

<p>The main passage from the lungs to the outer air
is the trachea or windpipe, a tube formed of from sixteen
to twenty rings of cartilage, united by tendons
and muscular fibres, and lined with mucous membrane.
At the top of the trachea is situated the larynx,
the organ of phonation, strictly speaking. The larynx
is built up of two cartilages, the thyroid and cricoid,
which represent developments of what once were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
uppermost two rings of the trachea. The cricoid cartilage,
forming the base of the larynx, is shaped like a
seal ring, with the bezel to the back. The thyroid
cartilage, just above the cricoid, has the form of an
open book, V-shaped in horizontal section. In the
interior of the larynx are two tiny cartilages, the right
and left arytenoids. These rest on top of the rear
portion of the cricoid, on which they rotate freely.</p>

<p>Figure I shows two views, front and rear, of the
cartilages of the trachea and larynx. Immediately
above and connected with the thyroid cartilage is the
hyoid bone, which serves as the attachment of the base
of the tongue. It is shaped like a horseshoe, the ends
pointing to the rear.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe18" id="ilo-p7">
  <img class="w100 p1" src="images/ilo-p7.jpg" alt="ilofig2" title="fig2ilo">
  <figcaption class="caption p11"><span class="smcap">Figure II</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Figure II presents a section of the interior of the
larynx, all the muscular tissues having been removed.
In this cut the position of the arytenoid cartilages is
plainly shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>By feeling the outside of the throat with the thumb
on one side and the forefinger on the other, the hyoid
bone and the thyroid and cricoid cartilages can easily
be located. The space between the two cartilages in
front is covered by the crico-thyroid membrane.</p>

<p>The muscles of the larynx are considered in two
groups, the extrinsic, those which connect the larynx
with the other parts of the body, and the intrinsic,
those which belong to the larynx strictly speaking.
By the extrinsic muscles the larynx is held in its place
in the throat. These muscles are usually held to have
no direct office in phonation.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe14_9375" id="ilo-p8">
  <img class="w100 p1" src="images/ilo-p8.jpg" alt="ilof3" title="f3ilo">
  <figcaption class="caption p11"><span class="smcap">Figure III</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The intrinsic muscles of the larynx are nine in number,
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>2 Thyro-arytenoids, right and left.</p>

<p>2 Crico-thyroids, right and left.</p>

<p>2 Lateral crico-arytenoids, right and left.</p>

<p>2 Posterior crico-arytenoids, right and left.</p>

<p>1 Arytenoideus.</p>

<p>In Figure III these muscles are plainly shown. This
cut presents a view of the interior of the left half of
the larynx; the right half of the thyroid cartilage has
been removed, together with the muscles which lie to
the right of the middle line of the larynx. We see
the muscles of the left side of the interior of the
larynx and also the right posterior crico-arytenoideus
and the right crico-thyroid.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe16_25" id="ilo-p9">

  <figcaption class="caption p11"><span class="smcap">Figure IV</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The thyro-arytenoideus muscles are attached in
front to the interior angle of the thyroid cartilage, and
at the back to the arytenoid cartilages. To their outer
edges the vocal cords are attached and the space between
them is called the glottis. The crico-thyroids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
are attached to the outer surfaces of the cartilages.
The lateral and posterior crico-arytenoids have very
complex attachments, which can be seen in Figure III.
The arytenoideus connects the rear surfaces of the two
arytenoid cartilages. In Figure IV a drawing of the
larynx is presented, looked at from above, the surrounding
parts having been dissected away to allow
a clear view of the muscles just considered.</p>

<p>It is impossible to state with absolute certainty just
what office the various intrinsic laryngeal muscles
have in the production of tones of different pitches
and qualities. Most of our information regarding
this subject has been obtained by means of the
laryngoscope. People interested in singing are now
very generally acquainted with this little instrument,
although it was invented by Manuel García so recently
as 1855. While it is generally used only by physicians,
anyone who wishes to can easily procure one and
by its means observe the actions of his own vocal
cords. The laryngoscope consists of a little mirror
fitted to a handle at an angle of about 100 degrees.
When used by a physician, it is held in the back of
the subject’s throat, the tongue being pulled forward
and to one side. A ray of strong light is reflected
into it from another mirror, which the observer straps
to his forehead. This ray of light is again reflected by
the laryngeal mirror so as to illuminate the vocal cords.
At the same time the observer sees in the laryngeal
mirror the image of the vocal cords and so studies
their movements.</p>

<p>While laryngoscopic observation has thrown much
valuable light on the operations of the laryngeal muscles,
it has not by any means cleared up all the mysteries
pertaining to this peculiarly intricate subject.
All the muscles concerned are very small. Each one
contains a vast and intricate number of tiny fibres,
extending in widely varying directions. As each one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
of these sets of fibres can be contracted with a greater
or less degree of strength than those most intimately
connected with it, the possibility of variety in the
combined actions of the laryngeal musculature is seen
to be almost unlimited. Many conflicting theories have
been offered to explain the details of the laryngeal
action, but a comprehensive review of the subject is
not called for here. Our purpose will be served by
stating the most generally accepted theory, without
committing ourselves as to its accuracy or sufficiency.
This theory is as follows:</p>

<p>In quiet breathing all the laryngeal muscles are in
a state of relaxation, with the possible exception of
the posterior crico-arytenoids. These muscles draw
the arytenoid cartilages apart, and so open the glottis.
For the production of a tone the glottis is closed by
the contraction of the arytenoideus, which pulls the
arytenoid cartilages together. The tension of the vocal
cords is regulated by two sets of muscles: first, the
thyro-arytenoids, to which the cords are directly attached;
second, the lateral crico-arytenoids, which rotate
the arytenoid cartilages, bringing their forward
spurs together.</p>

<p>The pitch of the tone is determined in two ways:
first, by the tension of the vocal cords; second, by their
effective length. In different parts of the vocal range
the manner of adjustment for pitch varies. For the
lowest notes of the voice, the chest register, the cords
vibrate in their full length. As the pitch rises in
singing an ascending scale passage in this part of the
voice, the tension of the vocal cords is gradually increased
by a corresponding increase in the strength
of the contraction of the thyro-arytenoids. When the
limit of the chest register has been reached, a further
ascent in pitch is brought about by the gradual shortening
of the vocal cords. This is effected by the contraction
of the lateral crico-arytenoids, which rotate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the arytenoid cartilages inward, as has just been described.
The forward spurs of these cartilages are
slightly curved in shape, so that, as they continue to
rotate, their point of contact is gradually brought further
and further forward. As the vocal cords are held
tightly together behind this point, the portion of the
cords left free to vibrate is shortened with each material
increase in the tension of the lateral crico-arytenoids.</p>

<p>With each shortening of the vibrating parts of the
cords the pitch is correspondingly raised. The portion
of the vocal range thus produced is called the
medium register. The highest note of the medium
register is reached when the forward spurs of the
arytenoid cartilages are in contact at their tips. Beyond
this point there can be no further shortening
of the vocal cords in this way. The remaining notes
of the compass, known as the head register, are secured
through a shortening of the effective length of
the vocal cords at their forward ends, as well as by a
further increase in their tension. Both these actions
are accomplished by the contraction of the thyro-arytenoids.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>What was said about the uncertainty of our present
knowledge concerning the laryngeal action applies
with almost equal force to the other operations of tone
production. Beyond the basic facts that the tones of
the voice are produced by the vibration of the vocal
cords and are reinforced and modified by the influence
of the resonance cavities, little can be stated with
absolute certainty. There is, of course, no question
as to the definiteness of our knowledge of the anatomical
structure of the parts involved. But, with regard
to the muscular operations of the resonance cavities
and the application of acoustic and mechanical principles
in these operations, the same uncertainty is encountered
as in the laryngeal actions. We shall continue
therefore to outline the most widely accepted
theories, without entering into a discussion as to their
soundness.</p>

<p>Considered acoustically, the voice is a wind instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
of the reed class. It differs, however, from all
other reed instruments in several particulars. It is
capable of producing a wide range of pitches, covering
more than three octaves in many cases, by the operation
of a single pair of reeds. Further, it has command
of an immense range of tone qualities, through
the combined action of its reed mechanism and its resonating
cavities.</p>

<p>For the production of tone the vocal cords are
brought together and held on tension with sufficient
strength momentarily to close the glottis and check
the outflow of the expired breath. As a slight degree
of condensation takes place in the air behind the cords,
they are forced apart and a tiny puff of air is allowed
to escape. Immediately the cords spring back, once
more close the glottis, and again check the outflow of
the breath. This is repeated a varying number of
times per second, the rate of rapidity of the succession
of puffs being regulated by the degree of tension of
the vocal cords, and by their effective vibrating length.
The pitch of the tone thus produced is determined
by the rate of the air puffs; these range from 75 per
second for the lowest usual bass note, 
<img class="w2" src="images/ilo1-p14.jpg" alt=""> to 1,417
per second for the highest usual soprano note, <img class="w2" src="images/ilo2-p14.jpg" alt="">.</p>

<p>The tone produced by the vibration of the vocal
cords is complex in its acoustic character, containing
the fundamental note and a large number of its overtones.
Yet as it leaves the cords the tone is weak in
power and of rather characterless quality. In order
to be of musical quality, volume, and carrying power,
the primary or vocal cord tone requires to be modified
and reinforced by the resonance cavities.</p>

<p>The resonating cavities of the voice, mastery of
which is considered essential to the scientific management
of the voice, are the chest, the mouth-pharynx,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the nasal passages, and the sphenoid, ethnoid, and
frontal sinuses. Each of these is adapted by its size
and shape to reinforce either the fundamental note or
certain of its overtones with especial prominence. In
order to produce a satisfactory tone each resonance
cavity must exercise its particular influence in the
proper way, their combined effect being necessary to
a correct use of the voice.</p>

<p>Much importance is attached by most vocal authorities
to the subject of chest resonance. It is believed
that the size of the chest cavity,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> much greater than
that of the other resonating spaces, adapts it especially
to the reinforcement of the fundamental note and its
lower overtones.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The mouth-pharynx cavity is capable
of extreme variability in both size and shape.
This mobility enables it to reinforce a wide variety of
overtones, and so to exercise a most important influence
in determining the quality of the tone. Another
function of this cavity is to increase the power of the
primary or vocal cord tone. To secure the effect of
crescendo in a single tone, the force of the expiratory
blast is gradually increased. In order that the tone
may be of uniform musical quality as it swells from
soft to loud, a corresponding increase must take place
in the size of the mouth-pharynx cavity. This is effected
by the gradual opening of the mouth by a lateral
expansion of the pharynx and by a lowering of
the base of the tongue. A slight elevation of the soft
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>palate may also contribute to the expansion of the
cavity.</p>

<p>A highly important feature of mouth-pharynx resonance
is the forming of the various vowel sounds.
Each vowel is simply a distinct quality of sound, caused
by the special prominence of some one or two overtones.
Helmholtz investigated this aspect of voice production
exhaustively. At first thought, it seems strange
that a tone on some one pitch gives the effect of a
particular vowel. Yet we can readily hear this in the
steam siren whistle commonly used for alarms of fire.
This produces a screaming sound, caused by a gradual
rise and fall of pitch through a range of several octaves.
Its almost vocal effect of ‘Ooh-oh-ah-eh-ee’
gives us a clear idea of the manner in which these
vowels are each the sound of a note somewhat higher
than the one preceding.</p>

<p>Helmholtz gives as the determining notes for certain
of the German vowels the following table:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe15" id="ilo-p16">
  <img class="w100 p11" src="images/ilo-p16.jpg" alt="ilop16" title="p16ilo">
</figure>

<p>For each vowel the mouth-pharynx must assume a
shape and size adapted to reinforce with special prominence
its particular note or notes. Anyone can readily
observe for himself what the positions of the tongue
and lips are for the various vowels. For <em>ee</em> the tongue
is arched high in the mouth and the lips are only
slightly parted. For <em>ah</em> the mouth is opened slightly
wider, while the tongue lies flat, etc.</p>

<p>No variation can be made in the size or shape of
the nasal and head cavities. As these hollow spaces
are small and very various in form, they reinforce
only the higher overtones. Special prominence given
to the higher upper partials<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has the effect of making
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>the tone brilliant and somewhat metallic in quality,
and it is here that the special function of nasal resonance
is seen. A certain degree of nasal resonance is
therefore essential to the correctly used voice, but this
must be kept within well-defined bounds. Excessive
prominence of this resonance is the cause of the unpleasantly
nasal sound which is absolutely out of
place in correct tone production.</p>

<p>There remains to be treated under this head the
production of consonant sounds. Consonant sounds
are of various acoustic characters and are formed in
a variety of ways. They may best be considered as of
two classes: those into which a tone produced by the
vocal cords enters and those devoid of this element.
The other determining factor in consonant formation is
the point at which an interruption takes place in the
outflow of the breath.</p>

<p>There are a number of allied pairs of consonants,
one with and the other without an accompanying vocal
sound. These are:</p>

<p class="indent5"><em>v</em> and <em>f</em><br>
<em>b</em> and <em>p</em><br>
<em>z</em> and <em>s</em><br>
<em>d</em> and <em>t</em><br>
<em>j</em> and <em>ch</em><br>
<em>th</em> (as in that) and <em>th</em> (as in think)<br>
<em>z</em> (as in azure) and <em>sh</em><br>
<em>g</em> and <em>k</em></p>

<p>In each of these pairs the interruption takes place at
the same point—<em>v</em> and <em>f</em> between the lower lip and the
upper teeth, <em>b</em> and <em>p</em> at the lips, etc.</p>

<p>Another class of consonants are the so-called sonants
or liquids, <em>l</em>, <em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, and <em>ng</em>. In these the vocal tone
may have appreciable duration; we can hum a tune
on any one of them; <em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, and <em>ng</em> are emitted solely
through the nostrils, the orifice of the mouth being
completely closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p><em>R</em> may be pronounced in two ways, the trilled or
rolled <em>r</em> being best for the purposes of singing. Another
form of this consonant, made by the vibration
of the uvula in contact with the back of the tongue,
is essential to a correct (conversational) pronunciation
of both French and German, although it has no place
in English. The rolled <em>r</em>, however, is generally used
in singing by both the French and the Germans.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A highly beneficial form of physical exercise is found
in the regular daily practice of singing. All the muscles
of the abdomen and thorax are strengthened by
this exercise; the lungs are developed to their greatest
normal capacity, and the habit is formed of breathing
at all times in the most healthful manner. Both the
circulation and the digestion share in the benefits derived
from regular vocal practice, and the general
health inevitably reflects the advantages incident to a
proper performance of these most important bodily
functions. An erect and graceful bearing, with well
poised head and shoulders and firm, elastic step, can
be secured through the correct practice of singing
more readily than in almost any other way.</p>

<p>Yet the professional use of the voice imposes considerable
restrictions on the singer’s habits of daily
life. As Sir Morell Mackenzie has said, the singer is
an athlete who must always be in training. A perfect
condition of the voice demands a perfect state
of general health. The singer must plan his whole life
in conformity with the demands imposed on him by
his art. The slightest indisposition of any kind is almost
invariably reflected in the voice. Under the conditions
in which people in the usual walks of life are
placed, slight colds and trifling upset states of the digestive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
organs are a matter of almost no concern. But
with the professional singer conditions are entirely
different. So delicate and finely adjusted are the
laryngeal muscles of the cultivated voice that their
‘tone’ may be upset by apparently insignificant causes.
The mucous membranes of the larynx and throat are
also highly sensitive to severe and unfavorable conditions.</p>

<p>It is necessary, therefore, for the singer to study
himself, to learn by experience what is good and
what is bad for him. This is a matter in which individual
peculiarities play so great a part that only very
general rules can safely be laid down. Singing within
less than two hours after the eating of a hearty meal
is almost certain to have an injurious effect on the
voice. Exposure and over-fatigue must be carefully
avoided. Stimulants, especially alcohol and tobacco,
have a markedly bad influence on the mucous membranes
of the throat. But beyond general statements
of this kind, so obvious indeed that their truth is fairly
well known, little can with safety be said as to the
regimen imposed on the singer. That one man’s meat
is another man’s poison is most strikingly true in its
application to the voice. Many famous singers have
been excessive smokers without seeming to suffer any
ill results from the habit. Yet with most vocalists tobacco
has a very irritating effect on the mucous membranes.
So, also, with regard to eating and drinking,
the widest differences of individual constitution are
seen. Hot drinks are beneficial to some voices, injurious
to others; cold drinks and ices are equally contradictory
in their influence on the voice. All these
questions of daily habit must be decided by each
singer for himself and experience is the only safe
guide.</p>

<p>There is a class of dangers to which the voice is
exposed, entirely distinct from the influence of unfavorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
conditions of the general health. Most of
the throat troubles to which singers and public speakers
are liable are directly traceable to a wrong use
of the vocal organs. One of the most striking facts
regarding the voice is this: If the voice is correctly
produced it is benefited by exercise and improves
steadily, year after year, in power, beauty, and facility
of execution. On the other hand, when the voice is
wrongly or imperfectly used exercise has exactly the
opposite effect. Badly produced voices constantly deteriorate;
their use results in course of time in throat
troubles, of which the number and variety seem almost
inconceivably great.</p>

<p>One general trouble lies at the bottom of all the
throat ailments which follow on a wrong use of the
vocal organs. This is a state of muscular strain suffered
by the delicate muscles of the larynx. Every incorrect
manner of producing vocal tone imposes an
excessive degree of effort on these muscles. On the
practical side the difference between the correct production
of tone and any wrong use of the voice may be
stated thus: When the voice is correctly used each
tiny muscle of the larynx exerts exactly the right degree
of effort in its contraction. To just this amount
of exertion the muscles are fitted by Nature and in
it they find their normal and healthful exercise. Incorrect
tone production, on the other hand, always
involves an excessive expenditure of effort on the part
of the laryngeal muscles. The throat is in a state of
muscular stiffness, in which all the muscles are contracted
with more than their normal and appropriate
degree of effort.</p>

<p>Muscular stiffness is indeed possible in any part of
the body. It can be well illustrated as follows: Take
a pencil and a sheet of paper and copy a few lines
of what you are reading; grasp the pencil with all the
strength of your fingers and exert all the power of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
hand and arm in forming the letters. You will find
that your arm and hand tire after a few minutes of
writing in this manner. This follows from the expenditure
of vastly more effort than is required for
the purpose of writing.</p>

<p>All the muscles of the body are arranged in opposed
pairs and groups. As your hand rests on the
table, the contraction of one set of muscles brings
the thumb and the first two fingers together so as to
grasp the pencil. An opposed set will, by their contraction,
spread these fingers apart, and the pencil will
be released. If, now, both these sets of muscles are
contracted at the same time the pencil is held stiffly,
and the hand moves to form the letters only by the
exertion of considerable effort. The muscles themselves
are stiffened by this simultaneous contraction of
opposed pairs and groups.</p>

<p>Throat stiffness, the characteristic feature of all incorrect
vocal actions, is exactly similar in its nature
to the stiffness of the hand and arm just considered.
The laryngeal muscles are also arranged in sets which
oppose their action one to another. One set (the posterior
crico-arytenoids) opens the glottis, another set
(the arytenoideus and the lateral crico-arytenoids)
closes the glottis and brings the vocal cords on tension.
Now, if the glottis opening muscles are contracted
during tone production, the opposed muscles
must put forth enough strength to overcome the effects
of this contraction in addition to that which they
are normally called upon to exert. This applies also
to all the other sets of laryngeal muscles. Through
this excessive tension the delicate laryngeal muscles
are strained and weakened, and in the course of time
the voice is permanently injured. This condition of
throat stiffness is by no means uncommon, a matter
for which modern methods of voice culture are to a
certain degree responsible. The attempt to manage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the vocal organs directly is very apt to lead to excessive
tension of the muscles.</p>

<p>Throat stiffness is very insidious in its workings.
It tends always to become more pronounced and to impose
a constantly greater strain on the voice. Yet in
its beginnings the singer may be completely unaware
of any trouble. The muscles of the larynx are very
poorly supplied with sensory nerves, so poorly, indeed,
that under ordinary circumstances we are utterly
unconscious of their movements. Owing to this fact,
a condition of strain may exist without making itself
manifest by any painful sensation. It thus comes
about that a singer may suffer from the constantly
progressing effects of throat stiffness before its results
are so pronounced as to be painful.</p>

<p>Yet there is one infallible way of determining whether
a voice is correctly used, or whether, on the contrary,
its production is characterized by excessive muscular
tension. This is found in the sound of the tones. Any
degree of throat stiffness is invariably reflected in the
sound of the voice. A throaty quality of tone always
results from an incorrect manner of production, and
this quality can result in no other way. While a keen
and highly experienced ear is needed to detect a slight
degree of throatiness, any ordinary observer can hear
this condition when it is very pronounced. True, it is
very much easier to detect a throaty quality in the
voice of some one else than in one’s own voice. The
singer labors under this disadvantage, that he can
never hear his own voice as clearly and with the same
discrimination as can the people who listen to him.
Yet by practice and careful attention this difficulty can
in great measure be overcome.</p>

<p>For the cure of throat stiffness and its attendant ills
the physician can do but little. Even the diagnosis
of the condition can hardly be said to lie within his
province. In very bad cases a swelling of the muscles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
inside the larynx can be detected, as well as a sympathetic
congestion of the mucous membranes. The existence
of nodes on the vocal cords, rather a rare condition
resulting from long-continued vocal strain, can
also be determined by laryngoscopic examination. But
in the case of the great majority of singers suffering
from the effects of throat stiffness the only competent
diagnosis is made by the vocal teacher, whose ear
is sufficiently trained and experienced to hear the
exact nature of the trouble. Further, it is the vocal
teacher alone who can relieve and permanently cure
the condition. The physician can allay the inflammation
of the mucous membranes and can temporarily
stimulate the vocal muscles. But no lasting relief
can be given in this way. Only one real cure is possible.
That is the abandonment of the incorrect habits
of tone production and the adoption of the correct
manner of using the voice.</p>

dealing with the subject of chest resonance. It is plain that the air in
the chest cavity could not possibly be thrown into regular vibrations. In
the acoustic sense the chest is not a hollow space, but a solid body. Filled
as it is with the spongy tissue of the lungs, as well as the heart and the
great blood vessels, there is no room for the formation of air waves or
the oscillation of air particles. Another form of resonance is involved here,

<p>Musical historians generally agree that the training
of voices for the purposes of artistic singing had its
beginnings about the year 1600. Voice culture as a
distinct department of musical education is held to
date no further back than the time when solo singing
first began to attract the attention of educated musicians.
This view, however, is altogether misleading.
From its very beginnings the art of music in Europe
was built upon the foundation of singing; no other
type of music was, indeed, recognized as a legitimate
branch of the art until music had progressed through
several centuries of development. Music was brought
up to the beginning of its present stage of evolution
through the working out of theories which were exemplified
in practice only by the use of voices. Counterpoint,
the basis of musical composition until well
along in the seventeenth century, had its origin in vocal
music; throughout its entire history, up to its highest
expression in the music of Palestrina and his school,
contrapuntal writing was applied only to works composed
for voices. Even if no records were to be found
of any means used for training the voice, the conclusion
would be inevitable that, throughout all these centuries
(roughly speaking, from the sixth to the seventeenth),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
some attention must have been paid to vocal development
and technique. It is true that anyone endowed
with a good voice can sing, with some degree of facility,
any simple music which he has the ability to memorize.
No technical training of the voice is needed
to enable one to sing simple songs. Folk-music was
the possession of the great mass of the people to whom
any ideas of vocal management were utterly unknown.
This was also true of the various classes of minstrels,
troubadours, etc. Although theirs was purely a vocal
art, the only training their voices ever received was that
incidental to the actual singing of their music. But
for the performance of the music incorporated in the
Roman ritual throughout all its history this untutored
style of singing would not have sufficed. A much better
command of the voice was needed than can be acquired
merely through the unguided singing of simple
folk-songs and lays. Precision, power, and facility of
voice were demanded in the music of the church and
these could not have been hit upon by accident. The
chances are all against a voice falling into the correct
manner of production if called upon to sing music of
any difficulty without some definite instruction. This
will be made clearer by a consideration of the peculiar
problem involved in any extended use of the voice.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Modern thought on the subject of vocal cultivation
has crystallized along well-defined lines. For one
thing, it has emphasized in a striking way the problem
of the management of the vocal organs. The fact is
now clearly recognized that the voice has one correct
mode of operating, as well as an almost limitless possibility
of wrong or incorrect forms of activity. When
the voice is correctly produced it can be used daily in
large halls and churches without strain or undue fatigue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
By judicious exercise, when rightly produced,
the voice is greatly increased in volume and power;
it acquires facility in the singing of difficult and elaborate
music; its compass is increased, giving it command
of a wider range of notes than is possessed by the
untrained voice.</p>

<p>Yet vocal cultivation demands the adoption of the
correct management of the vocal organs. When the
voice is correctly produced nothing more than judicious
exercise is needed to bring it to the condition of technical
mastery. But if the proper manner of producing
tone is not acquired, then the exercise of the voice
is fraught with peril to the vocal organs. Instead of
the voice being benefited by practice the contrary result
is almost inevitable. The use of a wrongly produced
voice on an extended scale, involving, as it must,
the daily attempt to produce tones powerful enough to
fill a large space, strains and injures the vocal organs.
This results in a weakening of the voice, in loss of
control, in discomfort and pain to the singer, in a
strained, harsh quality of tone, and finally, if persisted
in long enough, in complete loss of voice.</p>

<p>The difference between the correct use of the voice
and any incorrect manner of producing tone is inherent
in the organ itself. No one who wishes to sing
can elude the problem which Nature thus propounds.
On the contrary, the problem of vocal management
must be solved some time in the course of a singer’s
vocal studies or the technical command of the voice
can never be attained. Vocal cultivation is that form
of exercise of the voice which leads, through the correct
management of the organ, to a command of all the
voice’s resources of beauty, range, power, and flexibility.</p>

<p>Even on the earliest singers of the church a solution
of the vocal problem was imposed. These singers had
to perform daily in large cathedrals and churches;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
they had to sing their music in time and in tune. Some
measure of vocal cultivation was of necessity involved
in their training. We are, fortunately, not left in ignorance
of the methods applied in vocal training in the
centuries which preceded the rise of solo singing. Many
references to this subject found in the writings of early
musical historians have been gathered together by H.
F. Mannstein in his <em>Geschichte, Geist, und Ausübung
des Gesanges von Gregor dem Grossen bis auf unsere
Zeit</em> (Leipzig, 1845). Fétis also contains many passages
which throw valuable light on the subject It
is true that the subject has been considered rather
obscure, owing to the fact that students have looked
for something not to be found, that is, for rules bearing
on the mechanical management of the vocal organs.
In order to understand this subject fully the modern
conception of voice culture must first be briefly considered.</p>

<p>Modern methods of voice culture are based upon the
doctrine that the vocal organs must be consciously
guided by the singer in the correct performance of
their functions. The idea is that the voice must be
led to adopt the correct manner of action by direct
attention to its mechanical processes. According to
the present conception, the singer must see to it that
his vocal cords act in a certain way; that his breath is
controlled at the proper point; that the tones have the
correct origin and receive the influence of resonance
in the correct manner. Even back of this conception
lies a belief in the helplessness of the vocal organs to
hit upon the proper mode of acting without the conscious
direction of the singer. The singer must impose
a certain manner of operating on the voice and
carefully supervise all the processes of tone production.
This is the scientific view of voice culture; until quite
recently it was almost universally held.</p>

<p>It is almost incredible that this view is thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
modern and that its origin cannot be traced further
back than the invention of the laryngoscope in 1855.
Not until 1883 did the scientific view of vocal cultivation
find definite expression in the writings of any authority
on the voice; in that year Browne and Behnke,
in their book entitled ‘Voice, Song, and Speech,’
stated the scientific doctrine in plain terms, and asserted
that the voice cannot be controlled in any other
way than by attention to the mechanical processes of
the vocal organs. For many years thereafter this doctrine
went unchallenged, and methods of voice culture
treated as the most important materials of instruction
the means they embodied for enabling students of singing
to acquire direct conscious control over their vocal
organs.</p>

<p>An entirely different conception of voice culture has
recently been advanced and has indeed made great
headway. From the fact that the new doctrine found
its first complete statement in the writer’s ‘Psychology
of Singing’ (New York, 1908), it has come to be known
as the psychological theory, in contradistinction to the
mechanical theory embodied in the scientific system.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, the psychological theory of voice production
is as follows: To the vocal problem propounded
by nature the solution has also been furnished
by nature herself. Nature has endowed the voice with
a sufficient guide and monitor—the sense of hearing.
There is a direct connection between the cerebral centres
of hearing and the centres governing the muscles
of the vocal organs. The volitional impulse to produce
a certain sound involves the hearing of the sound in
imagination; through the nerve fibres connecting the
centres of hearing and of voice, the nerve impulse is
sent to the vocal organs which causes them to assume
the positions and perform the muscular contractions
necessary for the production of the desired tone. Thus
the voice is controlled by the ear, and it needs no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
form of control than that furnished by the ear. A correct
management of the voice in singing results in the
production of tones of a distinct characteristic sound,
while any incorrect use of the voice produces tones
which differ from the correct type, more or less, according
to the degree of faultiness in the vocal management.
The ear is the only reliable judge of the
voice. Only by listening to the tones it produces can it
be determined whether a voice is correctly used or not.
The object of vocal cultivation is first of all to enable
the voice to produce the correct type of tone. This
is accomplished by practice, which consists of repeated
efforts to sing tones of the type recognized by the ear
as correct. If the ear has the right conception of pure
tone, the vocal organs gradually fall into the way of
producing correct tones, that is, of operating in the
correct manner. In this the voice is guided by its own
instincts, which offer a safer and more efficient guidance
than that provided by the conscious management
of the vocal organs. No attention whatever need
be paid to the mechanical operations of tone production.
The vocal organs are informed by the mental
ear what is expected of them, and perform their functions
instinctively without any help from the intellect.</p>

<p>One advantage of the psychological doctrine is that
it at once dispels all the mystery which has seemed to
surround the early history of the subject, and which
has extended even to the method of the Italian teachers
of <em>bel canto</em>. Little notice has indeed been taken of
the systems of vocal cultivation which flourished before
the rise of the Italian school of vocal teachers.
But since the universal adoption of the scientific doctrine,
repeated efforts have been made to penetrate
the secret of the old method. These efforts have always
resulted in failure, for the reason already mentioned.
Investigators have sought to re-discover the
form of instruction used for the purpose of imparting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
a direct conscious control of the vocal organs; their
conviction that no other means of vocal command is
possible has blinded students of the subject to the instinctive
processes actually followed. As our main
purpose in the present chapter is to describe the system
now known as the old Italian method, a fuller treatment
of its records, both literary and traditional, will
be reserved for a later section. A review of the early
history of voice culture will lead most readily to the
consideration of the old Italian method.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Ancient systems of vocal culture call for only passing
mention. In the early civilizations of Egypt, Chaldea
and Assyria the art of singing was cultivated
assiduously. In the services of the temples this ancient
art found its most serious and dignified employment.
Each of the countries named possessed, at the time of
its highest civilization, a highly elaborate ritual of
worship, in which singing played a most important
part. Every temple had its corps of trained singers,
who were especially educated for this office. The most
important feature of the education of the temple singers
was the memorizing of the musical settings to
which the various poems and chronicles of the ritual
were sung and chanted. The course of instruction
consisted of the actual singing of the music, under the
tuition of a master whose memory was stored with the
entire devotional repertoire of the cult. A proper performance
of the music was the object sought, and to
this the most earnest attention was paid. But incident
to this was the production of the quality and type of
tones which experience had shown to be best adapted
to the use of the voice in the massive temples and in
the open-air services. The temple music schools were
under the constant supervision of the priests and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
officials in charge and the classes met regularly for
instruction and practice.</p>

<p>Very much the same system was followed in the
Temple at Jerusalem. Of the musical system developed
there we have a highly complete and satisfactory
record. Here the art of singing was carried to a very
high pitch of development. At the time of Solomon
there were 4,000 Levites attached to the Temple, whose
office it was to sing and intone the various services.
The elaborate ritual contained musical settings for the
Psalms and certain of the historical and prophetic
books, which demanded a high degree of vocal ability
for their rendition. Both the priests and the Levites
received a lengthy training in the singing of the music
allotted to them. The music of the Temple is especially
interesting to the student of the history of singing,
for the reason that it included a remarkably developed
system of vocal ornamentation. It would have
been impossible to sing this music without a thorough
command of the voice, and the education of the priests
and Levites therefore included a comprehensive system
of vocal cultivation.</p>

<p>The experience of the early masters of the old Italian
school taught them that the best means for training
the voice in facility and flexibility is the actual singing
of ornamental florid music. This was also the plan
followed in the school attached to the Temple. A system
of notation was in use, somewhat similar to that
of the neumes used in Europe from the ninth to the
thirteenth century. Every standard ornament and
melodic phrase was represented by a letter, according
to a strictly arbitrary system. A most important part
of the Temple method of musical instruction was the
memorizing of the various phrases, groups, runs, etc.,
represented by the significant letters. This was purely
a matter of convention, that is, the meaning of the letters
was recorded only in the memories of the instructors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and the graduate students. The instructor
taught the phrase for which a letter stood by singing it
for his students and having them sing it after him until
they had committed it to memory and learned to associate
it with the letter. As the musical phrases were
all melodious and in most cases ornamental, the voice
thus received an effective training. One of the puzzling
aspects of the first solo singing in European music is
the difficulty found in tracing the origin of the vocal
embellishments of which it so largely consisted. A
possible explanation of this mystery may be found in
the music of the Temple. How the traditions so carefully
treasured there could have found their way into
Italy after the lapse of nearly 2,000 years will be considered
in a later section of this chapter.</p>

<p>In classic Athens the voice was trained for the purposes
of both oratory and singing. A specially recognized
profession was that of the vocal trainer or
<em>phonascus</em>, whose duties embraced the vocal cultivation
of both singers and public speakers. A well-developed
system of voice culture was followed by these
teachers, who superintended classes in the daily practice
of systematic exercises. For the training of the
speaking voice a pupil began his daily practice by
repeating detached sentences at short intervals. From
this he passed to the declamation of long phrases, beginning
on the lowest notes of the voice, raising the
pitch gradually until the highest notes were reached,
and then again descending to the lowest range. The
exercises in singing were very similar, although greater
attention was paid to the sustaining of high notes.
Owing to the immense size of the Greek open-air theatres,
and to the masks that were always worn by the
actors, volume and power of voice were of the utmost
importance. The actors might justly be described as
singers, as all their speeches were delivered in a style
of vocal declamation not unlike our modern recitative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>Very much the same methods of vocal cultivation
were followed in ancient Rome, although much more
attention was paid to oratory than to singing. There
is no reason to believe that voice culture in Europe was
influenced in any way by the classic systems of either
Greece or Rome.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Vocal cultivation in Europe had an independent beginning.
It may be that some of the musical traditions
of the Hebrew Temple had been carried over into the
earlier churches which were founded in Italy, as there
is no doubt that the same traditions were adopted as
the basis of the Eastern church ritual at Constantinople.
Certain it is that prior to the reform of St. Ambrose
much of the music of the early Roman church
was highly ornamental in character. At any rate, with
the founding of the choir school attached to the Pontifical
chapel at Rome in the year 590 voice culture made
a new start; it underwent a steady development, and
continued to progress without interruption until it
reached its fullest fruition in the Italian school of singing
in the seventeenth century. The choir school at
Rome was intended to serve as a model for the entire
Western church; it supplied singers for the papal
choir, which was established to illustrate the proper
rendition of Gregorian music. At the beginning the
course of instruction followed in the Roman choir
school was extremely rudimentary, and so it continued
for several centuries. The <em>maestro di cappella</em> had as
part of his duties the training of the singers’ voices.
This was accomplished according to the purely instinctive
system followed in the similar schools of the ancient
temples. The students committed to memory
the music as it was sung by the choir master; in the
course of their constant repetition of the various musical
numbers their voices received the necessary training<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
and development. Schools similar to that at Rome
were established at all the great cathedrals and the
Roman system of musical instruction was thus spread
over the entire church.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages musical learning and
culture—what little there was of them—were the exclusive
property of the church, and the only centres of
musical instruction were the choir schools. Every
advance which music made during these centuries involved
an extension of the art of singing, and this
necessitated of course a corresponding progress of the
art of vocal training. Progress was painfully slow;
indeed little can be pointed out as marking any distinct
advance until the invention of the <em>sol-fa</em> system
of instruction by Guido d’Arezzo about the year 1100.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
On the basis of this system an entirely new form of
musical education was erected, which continued to
flourish until well along in the 17th century. The new
system of musical instruction consisted of what we
should now call a training in sight singing.</p>

<p>The first method of vocal culture worthy the name
was a natural outgrowth of the <em>sol-fa</em> system. Students
were trained in a knowledge of the intervals by singing
the <em>ut</em>, <em>re</em>, <em>mi</em> syllables in different combinations.
Choir masters were not slow to observe that this form
of study offered excellent means for acquiring a command
of the voice. With the exception of the first
one, <em>ut</em>, all the <em>sol-fa</em> syllables are sonorous and easily
sung. The difficulty attached to the singing of <em>ut</em> was
obviated by substituting for it the syllable <em>do</em>. Constant
singing of the syllables was found to have an admirable
effect on the voice, and they were soon adopted
as the basis of vocal instruction. <em>Sol-fa</em> practice was
made to serve a double purpose; both the ear and the
voice received the due measure of attention. Vocal
training was not at this time, nor indeed for several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>centuries later, thought to require any very close attention.
It was simply an incident in the general musical
education. The demands made on the voice were
slight in comparison with the requirements of the music
of a few centuries later. Music had long been
strictly unisonic in character, but about the time of
Guido the need of some addition to a single melody
began to be noted.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the single voice is the fact that while
capable of singing melodies of an almost infinite variety
it seems to the cultured ear to need support of some
kind. While untutored people are content to listen to
the singing of a voice without any accompaniment, a
certain degree of culture brings with it a sense of bareness
conveyed by a performance of this kind. Toward
the close of the dark ages this feature of the voice attracted
the attention of the church musicians. They
hit upon the device of having a second voice accompany
the first, singing another melody which should
have a pleasing effect in conjunction with the original
one. This marked the beginning of counterpoint, and
it gave a direction to the art of music from which it
did not depart for many centuries.</p>

<p>With the gradual extension of polyphonic writing
the education of singers became constantly a more
complex and exacting matter. Greater demands were
made on both the voice and the musicianship of the
choral singer. No great modification was, however,
made in the system of instruction; this developed
along the lines already marked out for it. Sight singing
continued to be the basis of musical education. As
time went on it became necessary for the singers to
master the system of musical notation, and this was
accomplished by a farther extension of the course in
sight singing. An understanding of the rules of counterpoint
was not obligatory on the part of the choristers,
but many of them received sufficient instruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
to fit them for both composition and teaching. Composers
and teachers were without exception graduates
of the choir schools; a musical education could not be
obtained elsewhere. Music study had indeed no other
purpose than to train students in the music of the
church. Instruction in counterpoint and composition
was not undertaken until the students had mastered
the rudiments of music and had also received their
vocal training in the sight singing classes. Every musician
was a singer as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Musical culture gradually spread from the church
and began to embrace a wider field. During the 15th
and the 16th centuries there was a steady approximation
of the two orders of music, scholarly and popular.
Every little royal and princely court had its retinue of
musicians. Polyphonic music had reached a degree of
development where its beauty brought it within the
reach of the enjoyment of the great mass of the people.</p>

<p>Composers had, indeed, begun to write secular ‘art’
music as early as the thirteenth century. As civilization
and culture advanced, and secular music received
a constantly greater measure of attention, the demands
made on lay musicians became more exacting. The
old fashion of singing and playing entirely by ear no
longer sufficed for the requirements of cultured people.
Musicians were obliged to fit themselves for their profession
by obtaining a fair degree of technical knowledge.
Many who had enjoyed the training of the choir
schools forsook their employment in the church and
devoted themselves to the practice of secular music.</p>

<p>The field of musical education also broadened. People
who looked forward to embracing the musical profession
began to seek instruction from graduates of the
choir schools. But the idea of private instruction did
not become popular for a long time. Music had always
been taught in special schools, and the need of
such schools of a secular character soon became manifest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
The first institution of this type to attain any
degree of prominence was that founded in Bologna in
1482 by a Spanish musician, Ramis di Pareja. It
adopted the system of instruction followed in the choir
schools. The century following the establishment of
the Bologna school was one of great activity in secular
musical instruction. Conservatories were founded in
most of the great European cities, although Italy was
the chief centre of education in music.</p>

<p>Polyphonic music had been steadily progressing and,
at the period we have now reached (the sixteenth century),
its proper performance called for singers of no
mean ability. The traditional system of musical education
had steadily expanded and had without difficulty
kept abreast of the demands made on it. The
strictly musical education of the singer required a
longer and more exacting course of study, and so also
did the technical training of the voice. Composers of
this period showed a marked fondness for florid counterpoint
and voices had to be cultivated to a high point
of flexibility to sing their works satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Yet no sweeping alteration was made in the system
of vocal cultivation. Flexibility of voice was acquired
through practice in the singing of individual parts of
contrapuntal works, those being chosen which presented
technical difficulties in a convenient form. This
advanced stage of vocal training was undertaken only
after the rudimentary principles of singing had been
mastered in the sight-singing classes. In spite of the
greater technical demands made on the voice, the
proper management of the vocal organs was not seen
to involve a problem of any difficulty. Sight singing
classes numbered sometimes as many as forty pupils.
The instructor in this primary grade was expected to
see that the students sang clearly and in tune, and that
they avoided the faults of nasality and throatiness.
To the matter of tone production the teacher could of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
course pay very little attention, as the rudiments of
music were the main subject of study. Yet the few
hints and corrections occasionally given by the sight-singing
teacher were all the instruction that the students
received in the management of the voice. On
the completion of the course in sight singing the students
were expected to produce their voices properly,
as well as to sing difficult music at sight. No pupil
could be admitted to the classes for advanced instruction
in singing whose voice was not properly controlled.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Up to the latter part of the sixteenth century there
was nothing to give promise of a sudden development
of solo singing. Popular music had as a matter of fact
consisted from time immemorial largely of singing by
a single voice. The musical instincts of the great mass
of the people had found expression in the folk-song,
while the semi-cultured classes had long cultivated the
arts of the various orders of Troubadours and Minnesingers.
But these popular forms of music were looked
upon by the trained musicians with a certain contempt.
Music had to be sung in parts by several voices in order
to be worthy of recognition as serious art. Polyphonic
music utterly ignores the capabilities of beauty and expressiveness
inherent in the single voice. When several
melodies are sung at once, each one of equal importance
with all the others, it is impossible for one
voice to receive more attention than another. Yet a
time came when music was forced to break the bonds
of polyphony and free itself from the restraints imposed
upon it by multiple part-writing. Greater command
of beauty and expressiveness was precisely the
end sought by those composers, notably Palestrina,
whose work marks the culmination of the polyphonic
school. The spirit of the time was seeking for greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
freedom in the expression of the musical instinct and
singers and musicians alike were moved by this spirit.
Solo singing was the inevitable result of a pressing demand.</p>

<p>Two entirely distinct sets of influences were instrumental
in leading musicians to experiment with the
solo voice. The first of these can be traced back to
the practising of individual parts in choral works as a
medium of vocal cultivation. A singer practising a
part of this kind by himself could not fail to notice
that he used his voice with greater freedom and satisfaction
than when obliged to consider only the effect
of his voice in conjunction with other singers. So also
would the master who was instructing him in his part.
Highly significant is the fact that this discovery was
made in the singing of florid music. Rather elaborate
passages of the florid type were selected for vocal
practice and these would naturally be adapted for
bringing out the purely sensuous beauty of the voice.
Florid counterpoint thus contained within itself the
germs of coloratura singing. As singers began to recognize
the beauties of their own individual voices, the
desire naturally arose to display these beauties to
others. Opportunity for vocal display was, however,
lacking, as no music had ever been written for the solo
voice. This difficulty was finally overcome by a singer
performing only one part of a contrapuntal work and
having the other parts played as an accompaniment
by instrumental performers. The first solos sung in
the history of European musical art were of this type.
As early as 1539 a four-part madrigal was produced in
this manner, the highest soprano part being sung as a
solo. The fashion spread rapidly and solo singing
soon began to attract the serious attention of musicians.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>
<p>Singers were of course anxious to exhibit their
voices. Polyphonic music offered them little scope in
this regard, for florid writing was distributed among
the various parts and it was impossible for the artists
to find works which contained more than an occasional
ornamental passage for any one voice. They hit naturally
upon the device of adding ornaments according
to their own taste and fancy to the part selected for
solo performance. Kiesewetter reproduces a madrigal
sung in this manner by a noted soprano singer, Vittoria
Archilei, in 1589. Both the original soprano part
and the same part as embellished by Archilei are reproduced
here.</p>

<p>Vocal ornamentation had by this time become a
recognized fashion among the singers. Considerable
mystery surrounds the origin of the various ornaments
and fiorituri which were adopted by the singers at
this early period in the history of solo singing. A possible
source from which they may have been drawn
was mentioned in our remarks on the music of the
Temple at Jerusalem. Much of this music was preserved
by tradition and was incorporated, with modifications
of course, in the ritual of the Greek Catholic
church at Constantinople. Highly ornamental in character,
it was performed regularly in the Greek church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
for many centuries. At the dispersal of the cultured
Greeks following the capture of Constantinople by the
Turks in 1452, many musicians trained in the music of
the Greek church found their way into Italy. This
gradual exodus continued indeed for many years, and
it is probable that the traditions of ornamental music
thus came to the knowledge of the Italian singers.
Certain it is that the early singers adopted the same
type of ornamentation which had been perfected at
Jerusalem nearly 2,000 years previously. Exactly the
same variety of turns, trills, runs, <em>gruppetti</em>, etc., are
contained in the following examples of Hebrew and
Greek music as were employed by the solo singers at
the close of the sixteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not necessary, however, to speculate on the
causes which led the first solo singers to adorn their
songs with <em>fiorituri</em>. Ornamental singing has always
been a natural and instinctive form of expression. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
fondness of primitive peoples for vocal embellishments
has been noted by many observers, prominent among
whom is Frederick R. Burton (‘American Primitive
Music,’ New York, 1909). In the Orient singing of the
florid type has always had its home. Returning Crusaders
brought back with them many songs and melodies
from Palestine, all characterized by runs, turns,
and other ornaments. The fashion was taken up by
the Troubadours and Trouvères, who familiarized their
hearers with the idea of melodic elaboration by means
of florid passages. Even in the church the officiating
priests for many centuries had a fondness for introducing
ornaments in their singing of the masses. Ornamental
singing seems to be prompted by some deep-seated
instinct and its universal popular appeal must
be attributed to the same instinct.</p>

<p>Coloratura singing was thus the foundation of the
new art of vocal solo performance. Musical historians
generally attach more importance in this connection
to the invention of dramatic recitative. This is due in
great measure to the fact that the records deal much
more fully with the latter subject, and also to the
adoption of declamatory recitative as the basis of the
art form of opera.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Solo singing owed its sudden and
unprecedented bound into popularity to the delight
which people took in vocal ornamentation. Even the
opera itself was indebted for its rapid advance to the
public demand for coloratura singing. Indeed it seems
hardly too much to say that coloratura singing was the
first type of art music to find its way to the affections
of the general public.</p>

<p>Up to about 1600, artistic music, despite its rapid development
in the hundred years preceding, had been
the possession only of the cultured and wealthy classes.
But with the opening of the opera houses the new art
form was brought within the reach of the great body
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>of the people. That the public responded so enthusiastically
to the new form of entertainment thus offered
them was due in great measure to the delight people
took in coloratura singing. Composers soon found that
in order to please the public they must provide ornamental
solos for the singers. This was of course opposed
to the views of the little group of Florentine
gentlemen who projected the first performances of
opera; they considered musical declamation to be sufficient
for all the purposes of a truly dramatic art. But
the public thought otherwise and demanded to hear
the singers in solos which displayed the full beauties
of their voices. Monteverdi’s <em>Orfeo</em>, produced in 1607,
contains a number of elaborate coloratura songs.</p>

<p>A striking fact regarding the system of vocal instruction
in vogue during the later decades of the sixteenth
century is that it sufficed for the training of the first
solo singers. Artists whose education had not been
designed to fit them for the performance of solo music
were yet able to take up this music and to sing it satisfactorily
after they had left their teachers. Even
though it was intended only for the performance of
choral works, the system of vocal training then in
vogue enabled singers to master the new art of solo
singing for themselves. The advance of solo singing did
not lead to the abandonment of the traditional course
of instruction. On the contrary, the same system continued
to be applied, extended only to meet the new
requirements imposed on it by the great elaboration of
vocal technique. By 1650 coloratura singing was firmly
established as the favorite branch of music, and for
more than 200 years following it was one of the chief
glories of the art.</p>

<p>An abundance of singers of a high degree of excellence
were provided by the conservatories and by the
many private teachers who practised their profession
in the chief cities of Italy. The most famous musicians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
did not disdain to embrace the new profession of voice
culture. A sincere devotion to the art of <em>bel canto</em> was
displayed by the teachers of the early part of the seventeenth
century; each one strove to advance the standards
of singing, to discover new possibilities of beauty,
range, and flexibility in the voice, to invent new and
delightful ornaments. The composers vied with the
vocal teachers in seeking always for greater beauty and
expressiveness. How successful they were is proved
by the rapid expansion of the opera.</p>

<p>A marked influence in the elevation of the standards
of singing was exerted through the introduction of the
male soprano voice. Whether the voices of the <em>castrati</em>
possessed all the wonderful charm and beauty of quality
attributed to them by musical writers of the time
we cannot now determine. But there is no question
that voices of this type are specially favored in their
ability to master the most astounding technical difficulties.
The <em>castrati</em> enjoyed an almost incredible
popularity. More has been written about Farinelli and
Caffarelli than about any other artists of the old <em>bel
canto</em> period. Historically considered, the singers of
this type are highly important because of the contribution
they made to the elevation of the vocal art. Their
achievements became the standard toward which all
other artists were called upon to strive. While we
need have no regret over the disappearance of the male
soprano, his value in the development of <em>bel canto</em>
cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>A lineal succession of vocal teachers was well established
by 1630. Several masters of the art had acquired
excellent reputations even so early as 1600.
Each famous teacher had many pupils who in their
turn took up the profession of teaching and who almost
invariably based their claims to recognition on
the reputation of the master, as well as on their own
excellence as singers. This maestral succession, or
rather many of them, continued down to comparatively
recent times. The changed conditions which came
about in the twenty years following the invention of
the laryngoscope (1855) finally broke down the influence
of the teachers who had inherited the old masters’
system, and the authority of the old method was
for a time almost destroyed. In recent years, however,
there has been a great revival of interest in the methods
of instruction followed by the old masters. There
is a growing feeling that scientific methods have not
fulfilled their promise, and vocalists look back upon
the earlier centuries of voice culture as a golden age
which has passed away.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The old Italian method is now considered to have
possessed some merits which are not shared by modern
scientific systems. Yet a certain degree of mystery
still surrounds the old method. Welcome as its revival
would be to many teachers and students, great difficulty
is met with in determining of just what it consisted.
Many analyses and explanations of the old
method have indeed been suggested. But as these consist
almost entirely of attempts to find in it some means
for the direct conscious management of the vocal organs,
they have necessarily brought forth little that is
of value. All the mystery surrounding the old method
is dispelled by the understanding that it did not treat
the vocal problem as capable of solution by mechanical
means.</p>

<p>The old Italian method was simply an amplification
of the system of vocal education which had been in
course of development for nearly a thousand years.
It embodied no new conception of vocal management,
but continued to treat the control of the voice as a
purely instinctive matter. Its chief contribution to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
the technical training of the voice was the adoption
of <em>vocalises</em> and exercises specially designed
for this purpose. Even that was a matter of
rather slow development. During the early decades of
the seventeenth century vocal teachers continued to
select passages from standard musical works which
lent themselves readily to the technical exercise of the
voice, just as the teachers of the preceding century had
done. Gradually it came to be seen that greater satisfaction
could be obtained from the use of compositions
arranged to bring in the various technical points
and vocal embellishments one or two at a time. Thus
the voice could be led by an easy gradation to the mastery
of every technical difficulty and its training was
rendered easier and more expeditious.</p>

<p>But the general scheme of instruction continued to
be patterned after the traditional model. A complete
musical education, not only the special cultivation of
the voice, was the goal. The plan of combining the
preliminary training in vocal management with instruction
in the rudiments of music continued to be followed
as late as 1750. Many famous masters employed
assistant teachers to perform the drudgery of the initial
stages of instruction, considering that their own
high degree of culture entitled them to deal only with
advanced students. This custom continued for at least
one hundred years, and Tosi (1723) speaks of it as a
system so well established as to need no comment.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that a course of instruction in
singing according to the old Italian method required
from five to seven years of study. This is in one sense
true. Yet it is by no means the case that so long a
time was devoted to the technical training of the voice.
A thorough musical education was included in this
course, of which the first two or three years were spent
entirely on the rudiments of music. The course of
instruction included also a complete training for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
operatic stage, as well as a repertoire of parts sufficient
to enable the graduating student to secure an engagement
at one of the opera houses. In the latter part of
the eighteenth century specialization in vocal education
began to be the rule. Students whose parents foresaw
for them the possibilities of a vocal career were prepared
by a thorough musical education before being
sent to a vocal teacher. Under these circumstances the
technical training of the voice was frequently accomplished
in less than two years.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It is to be regretted that so little mention is made by
musical historians of the methods of instruction followed
by the old masters. Vocal teachers of the old
school seem to have been so absorbed in their work
that the idea of writing books seldom occurred to them.
A vast quantity of <em>vocalises</em> composed by teachers for
their students has been preserved and many of these
are incorporated in books of exercises now available.
A few masters were, however, thoughtful enough to
provide posterity with some knowledge of their system
of instruction. The first of these was Caccini, whose
importance as a vocal teacher should not be overlooked
on account of his especial eminence as the first composer
to write music for the solo voice.</p>

<p>In 1601 Caccini published a large number of his
compositions for the solo voice under the title of <em>Le
Nuove Musiche</em>, a book which is now of almost inestimable
value. It contains vocal pieces in both the styles
then in vogue. It is surprising to see from some of these
florid songs the high degree of vocal virtuosity possessed
by the singers of that early time. In his preface Caccini
gives an outline of his system of vocal training. This
consists entirely of rules and directions for the execution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
of the various ornaments of singing. Here he
shows himself to have possessed a pure and refined
taste, as well as a most profound love for the beauties
of the voice. Yet he does not touch on the subject of
vocal management, proving that he had not had occasion
to depart from the instinctive methods in which
he himself had been trained.</p>

<div class="chapter"><p>Two other interesting works by teachers of the old
school are ‘Observations on the Florid Song’ (1723),
by Pietro Francesco Tosi, and <em>Riflessioni Pratiche sul
Canto Figurato</em> (1776), by Giovanni Battista Mancini.
Both these writers devote themselves mainly to a discussion
of vocal embellishments and <em>fiorituri</em>, just as
did Caccini so many years earlier. What little they
say about the management of the voice shows that the
old idea of reliance on instinctive vocal guidance had
not weakened in their day.</p>
</div>

<p>Another highly valuable work, the latest which can
be considered of original value in throwing light on the
old Italian method, is the <em>Méthode de Chant du Conservatoire
de Musique</em> (Paris, 1803). This method was
drawn up by the most eminent musicians in Paris at
that time, including even Cherubini and Méhul. They
and several others of almost equal rank were commissioned
by the revolutionary government to devise an
official system of vocal education. Yet there is nothing
revolutionary about the method, for it does not depart
in any important particular from the system of instruction
described by Tosi and Mancini.</p>

<p>Particular interest attaches to the <em>Méthode</em> because it
was the first complete practical work on its subject ever
published. Tosi and Mancini did not include a single
exercise or musical illustration in their books, but contented
themselves with verbal descriptions of the portamento,
messa di voce, appoggiatura, etc. The <em>Méthode</em>
on the other hand consists almost entirely of a collection
of exercises, scales, vocalises, and arias, carefully
graded according to difficulty. These were collected
from many sources by the most celebrated vocal
teacher in Paris at that time, Bernardo Mengozzi, the
head of the vocal department at the Conservatoire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
Everything necessary for the thorough cultivation of
the voice according to Mengozzi’s conception of the
subject was included in the <em>Méthode</em>. A student was
expected to start with the first exercise and study each
one consecutively, the voice steadily progressing until
technical perfection was assured with the mastery of
the last aria. No distinction was made between voices,
high and low, male and female, for all were put through
the same course of study. Cherubini thought so highly
of the <em>Méthode</em> that he took a copy with him on his
visit to Vienna in 1805 for the purpose of himself presenting
it to Beethoven.</p>

<p>All that has come down to us of the oral traditions
of the old school is summed up in a set of cogent
phrases which are commonly known as the traditional
precepts. These are, ‘open the throat,’ ‘sing on the
breath,’ ‘sing the tone forward,’ and ‘support the tone.’
No literary authority can be given for the precepts, as
they are not mentioned in any works published earlier
than about 1830. It is possible that they do not date
back much further than this. Perhaps they represent
the first attempts made by vocal teachers to interpret
their instruction according to the scientific ideas of
vocal operation which were just beginning to become
current about that time.</p>

<p>How this could have been the case is readily seen.
A perfect vocal tone sounds as though it floats on the
breath. The correct singer’s throat seems to the hearer
to be loose and open and the tone seems to be lodged
in the front of the mouth. When the attention of vocal
teachers began to be turned to the mechanical operations
of tone production they might naturally have
been led to observe first those salient features of tone
which seem to point to a definite vocal action.</p>

<p>Yet it is more likely that the old masters actually
used the precepts in instruction merely to point out to
their pupils these striking peculiarities in the sound of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the perfect vocal tone. We know that they always held
up before their students a high ideal of artistic singing.
A use of the precepts in this way would be of great
service in helping the students to hear how perfect
singing should sound. To imitate successfully it is
necessary in the first place to hear distinctly. Pointing
out the marked characteristics of the perfect tone enables
the ear to know what to listen for.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the old Italian method
was never standardized. No such thing as a school of
recognized authority, to whose principles all teachers
were obliged to adhere, was ever evolved. Each master
taught according to his own ideas, and no central
authority or governing body ever undertook to lay out
a standard method. Yet the old masters all followed
the same general plan of instruction. In some of its
aspects this plan is thoroughly understood. Students
were taught to sing correctly and artistically solely
through the exercise of their voices in actual singing.
The materials used for vocal training were scales, exercises,
and vocalises without and with words. These
were without exception melodious, and the musical and
artistic aspects of singing received attention from the
beginning of instruction to the end. Singing was considered
always on its <em>musical</em> side and its <em>mechanical</em>
features were never touched upon. The voice was led
on by a gradual progression from the easy to the difficult.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century it was the custom for
the teachers to compose exercises and vocalises specially
for each pupil, suiting the technical and musical
requirements to the pupil’s stage of advancement. As
this custom died out, teachers provided themselves with
extensive and carefully graded lists of compositions in
all the various styles suitable for instruction.</p>

<p>Coming finally to the question, what means the old
masters utilized for imparting the correct management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
of the voice, we find that in the sense in which this
problem is understood in modern vocal science they
had no method whatever. It is difficult for one imbued
with the idea of direct vocal management to believe
that the voice can possibly be trained without the student
knowing in the first place how to produce his
tones correctly. Yet it would have been equally hard
for a master of the old school to understand what we
moderns mean by the conscious control of the vocal
organs. It never entered into the minds of the old
masters that there could be any difficulty about the
management of the voice. ‘Listen and imitate’ summed
up for them all that need be known, indeed all that
could be known on the subject. They aimed directly
at tonal perfection as a matter of sound and did not
think of attempting to reach it by the roundabout
course of vocal mechanics.</p>

<p>The early teachers of the old school were the direct
inheritors of the traditions stored up as the result of
the experiences of vocal instructors through a period of
many centuries. During all this time the voice had
been allowed to operate according to its own instincts.
Although in the last century of this period the rapid
advance of the musical arts had imposed demands of
constantly increasing difficulty on the voice, it continued
to fulfill these demands in its own instinctive
way. The ability of the voice to produce the tones
exacted of it by the ear was never doubted. There was
no need for a vocal teacher of the old school to formulate
or justify his belief in the voice’s ability to follow
the guidance of the ear. No one at that time had ever
thought of questioning this ability. Yet if one of these
masters had been called upon to state in doctrinal form
his theory of the vocal action, it would probably have
been something like this:</p>

<p>The correct use of the voice, that manner of vocal
emission which leads through practice to technical perfection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
is naturally acquired by exercise in the actual
singing of correct tones. Provided the student have a
clear mental conception of the type of vocal tone which
results from a correct manner of tone production, the
voice will gradually adapt itself to the correct form of
action, through repeated efforts at imitating the correct
tone as a matter of sound. In order to practise singing
effectively it is necessary only that the ear shall be acquainted
with the sound of a properly produced tone
and that it shall demand tones of this character from
the voice. Faults of production, whether throaty,
nasal, or breathy tones be the result, will gradually disappear
as the student learns to hear his own voice with
greater keenness and accuracy. The correct use of the
voice is gradually acquired and there is no time in the
course of this progress at which any change takes place
in the manner of directing and guiding the voice.</p>

<p>A high standard of musical beauty and vocal excellence
was always kept prominently before the minds of
the pupils. The students were required to know how a
correctly sung passage should sound, and all their practice
was aimed at the imitation of this sound. The ear
was expressly recognized as the sole judge of vocal
correctness. When a pupil sang incorrectly the master
would imitate the faulty tones, for the pupil to hear
what was wrong in the sound. Then the master would
sing the passage correctly, that the pupil might hear
the perfect tones and adopt them as a model for imitation.</p>

<p>So far as our present knowledge of the old method
goes, it embodied no definitely stated principles for the
management of the voice. Although the problem of
tone production is, in present estimation, the most important
topic of voice culture, the older system seems
to have ignored this problem completely. It simply
took for granted that the voice will operate correctly if
it is guided by a keen ear and directed by a fine musical
and artistic sensibility. No doubt it had its failures,
but we have a record only of its successes. These were
so many and so brilliant that we must accord to the
old Italian method the recognition due to a complete
and satisfactory system of voice culture.</p>

</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Students of the history of voice culture usually consider
that the invention of the laryngoscope (1855)
marks the beginning of the modern scientific system of
training the voice. It is of course convenient to have
a precise date to which any important change in human
beliefs can be referred. Yet in this matter it is
hardly possible to fix upon any one event as the only
influence which brought about the change. As a matter
of fact, there was a gradual and for a time almost imperceptible
transition from the so-called empirical
methods of the old school to the modern methods.</p>

<p>Scientific investigation of the vocal mechanism began,
so far as the record shows, with Hippocrates, 460
B. C. His work on anatomy contains references to the
vocal organs, showing that he had some ideas, rather
vague it is true, about their structure. Aristotle (384
B. C.) recognized the larynx as the point of production
of the voice. Galen (130 A. D.) wrote a valuable
treatise on the anatomy of the throat. He gave the
name of glottis to the space between the vocal cords,
and his work was the standard authority on the subject
for more than fifteen hundred years. Fabricius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
of Aquapendente, 1537, published a work embodying
the results of his own dissections of the throat. He
added greatly to the materials of Galen, although his
ideas of the operations of tone production were hardly
so sound as those of his classic predecessor.</p>

<p>In 1741 a French physician, Ferrein, published a
little treatise entitled <em>De la Formation de la Voix de
l’Homme</em>. This marks the beginning of the modern
interest in the subject of the vocal action, as it was the
first work on vocal physiology to receive any attention
from those interested in singing. Among other things
Ferrein gave the name of vocal cords to the edges of
the muscles inclosing the glottis.</p>

<p>Dutrochet in 1806 compared the action of the glottis
to that of the lips in playing the horn. He asserted that
the sonorous vibrations of vocal sounds are generated
by the muscles whose edges are formed by the vocal
cords, and not by the vocal cords alone. Liscovius, in
1814, and Savart, in 1825, also published treatises, but
their work served rather to foster the growing interest
in the subject than to add anything of value to the general
fund of knowledge. Johannes Müller, in 1837,
showed that a compass of two octaves can be obtained
by forcing air through an exsected larynx and varying
the tension of the vocal cords.</p>

<p>In the early years of the nineteenth century the results
of scientific investigation of the voice began to
attract the attention of the most enlightened vocal
teachers. There was indeed no dissatisfaction with the
methods of instruction then in vogue. Yet a general
feeling can be noted by a student of the literature of
the subject as setting in about that time, a feeling that
systems of voice culture might be improved by applying
to them the results of the most recent scientific discoveries.
Two important works by vocal teachers may
be cited in this connection, <em>Die Kunst des Gesanges</em>, by
Adolph Bernhard Mark (1826), and <em>Die grosse italienische<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Gesangschule</em>, by Heinrich F. Mannstein
(1834). In both of these books the point of view generally
held at that time is clearly indicated. While the
old Italian method was held to be thoroughly satisfactory
in every respect, there is a desire to explain this
method and to place it on an assured basis of demonstrated
scientific principles. No thought of direct vocal
management as a necessity, or even as a possibility, can
be discovered in these two works.</p>

<p>Manuel García (1805-1906), the vocal teacher who
contributed most to the promulgation of the scientific
idea, had at the beginning of his career exactly the
same plan as Mannstein and Mark. His father, Manuel
del Popolo Viscenti, was one of the most eminent musicians
of the time. Famous as singer, teacher, impresario,
and composer, the older García was in possession
of all the traditions of the Italian school. From
his father García received the traditional method in its
entirety. Retiring from the operatic stage in 1832,
García took up actively the profession of voice culture.
Even as early as this he had definitely formulated a
plan for the improvement of vocal methods. Yet at
that time he had in mind nothing of the nature of a
sweeping change. In the preface to his first important
work, <em>École de García</em>, 1847, he stated that his intention
was ‘to reproduce my father’s method, attempting
only to give it a more theoretical form, and to connect
results with causes.’</p>

<p>With this seemingly modest program García could
not rest content. His ambition to penetrate all the
mysteries of the voice led him to master the anatomy
of the throat, as well as what was then known of acoustics.
He was impatient to know what actually takes
place in the larynx during the production of tone.
After several years of experimenting he finally succeeded
in viewing his own vocal cords by means of a
little mirror held in the back of the throat. His announcement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
of his invention was published in the proceedings
of the Royal Society of London in May, 1855.</p>

<p>By this time the idea of the improvement of voice
culture was very generally held. García’s invention
was hailed as the beginning of a new era in vocal instruction.
It was coming also to be generally felt that
the only way in which the scientific knowledge of the
voice could be utilized in instruction would be by having
the student of singing cause his vocal organs to
operate in the manner that science had shown to be
correct. While no one at that time stated this principle
in definite terms, it was generally assumed as a
matter of course. Within the twenty years following
García’s invention the doctrine of the scientific management
of the voice had been almost universally
adopted. Against this tacit conviction in favor of the
necessity of direct vocal management the instinctive
methods of the old masters could make no stand. The
old method gradually disappeared and the doctrine implied
in the empirical system—that the voice needs no
guidance other than that furnished by the ear—found
no defenders. Since 1875 the belief in the necessity of
consciously governing the vocal organs has been the
dominating idea of vocal students and teachers
throughout the world.</p>

</div>

<p>Of importance only second to García’s study of the
vocal cord action was Helmholtz’s analysis of the
acoustic laws of resonance, especially as they apply to
tone and vowel formation. Merkel’s <em>Der Kehlkopf</em>
(1873) is the standard work on the operations of the
larynx. Dr. Louis Mandl, in <em>Die Gesundheitslehre der
Stimme</em> (1876), first announced the principle of breath
control. A vast number of other investigators have
contributed to the subject and it is safe to say that the
vocal action has been studied from every conceivable
point of view. It is, however, not necessary here to
trace the development of vocal science and to record
the work of each student who has made original contributions
to the common fund of knowledge.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>In our first chapter the generally accepted theories
regarding the operations of the vocal mechanism were
outlined, and the same plan will be followed in describing
the scientific methods of instruction most
widely adopted. Modern methods of voice culture
have indeed never been standardized. While teachers
generally have adopted very nearly the same course,
there is a wide diversity of opinion and practice to be
found concerning each one of the topics of vocal science.
Almost every one of these topics has indeed been
the subject of controversy. Yet within recent years the
leading authorities have come into fair accord in their
application of the various principles. We shall therefore
describe the method which has in its favor a consensus
of opinion on the part of the best recognized
teachers, without offering any statement as to its
soundness or adequacy.</p>

<p>First it will be necessary to point out the exact position
which the scientific element occupies in the modern
system of voice culture. Vocal science has never
aimed at a complete revolution of the practices of instruction
in singing. Its purpose is rather to divide
this instruction into two stages and to take as its province
only the first stage. Starting with the well known
fact that the voice has only one correct mode of operating,
it seeks to impart this correct manner of tone
production to the student as a preliminary to the technical
training of the voice, strictly speaking. This is
the only important point in which the modern system
differs from the old Italian method. The initial work
of imparting the correct vocal action is commonly
called the ‘placing of the voice.’ To accomplish this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
the sole purpose of vocal science, and the scientific
method of instruction is designed only to apply to this
initial stage. When the correct management of the
voice has been acquired through a course of instruction
according to scientific principles, the student is held
to be ready to undertake the technical and musical
education of the singer. This second stage of instruction
is conducted almost exactly according to the system
of the old masters.</p>

<p>Four elements are included in the scientific system
of vocal training. These follow naturally the four distinct
operations of singing—breathing, laryngeal action,
resonance, and articulation.</p>

<p>Exercises designed to impart the correct manner of
breathing are usually given first as toneless gymnastic
drills. The student is instructed to fill the lungs in a
prescribed fashion (generally that described in Chapter
I), and to make sure that the expansion of abdomen
and chest takes place exactly according to rule. Practice
in the muscular control of the expiration is combined
with these preliminary breathing exercises, so
soon as they can be performed with fair facility. When
the muscular movements of breathing have been mastered
as a toneless exercise, the practice is extended
to exercises combined with tones, on single notes and
scale passages. In these attention is paid to the proper
attack and emission of the tone, as well as to the correct
management of the breath. A great variety of
breathing exercises have been formulated, but as their
basic principle is always the same they call for no extended
description. Any one of an athletic turn who
has himself mastered the correct manner of breathing
would have no difficulty in devising exercises suitable
for imparting this system to others.</p>

<p>To secure the proper action of the vocal cords and
laryngeal muscles the entire throat must be held in a
state of supple relaxation before attacking a tone or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
phrase. In order to start a tone correctly a full inspiration
is to be taken, then the vocal cords are to be
brought to the degree of tension necessary for the desired
pitch at the precise instant the expiration starts.
The tone must be attacked squarely on the correct
pitch and no breath allowed to escape before it starts.
The breath pressure is to be held evenly and correctly
managed throughout the entire expiration.</p>

<p>To secure this proper action of the vocal cords the
so-called ‘stroke of the glottis’ was advocated by García.
The glottic stroke is an explosive sound, formed
when the vocal cords are forced apart suddenly by a
rather powerful breath pressure. Its most frequent
natural occurrence is in the action of coughing, of
which it is the most striking auditory characteristic.
Although command of the glottic stroke can be acquired
without difficulty, it is utterly out of place in
finished singing. What García had in mind in advocating
the glottic stroke is declared by many of his
graduate students to have been something entirely
different from a violent explosion of the tone. All he
sought was the starting of the tone without any previous
escape of the breath. The stroke of the glottis,
strictly so called, has been almost entirely abandoned
by vocal teachers. Later authorities modified this instruction
somewhat by teaching the ‘slide of the glottis,’
which brings about the same action without the explosive
sound of the glottic stroke. Of recent years,
owing to the better understanding of the principles of
breath control, it has been found that neither the stroke
nor the slide of the glottis is necessary. The same result
can be reached by bringing the vocal cords to the
desired degree of tension at the instant the expiration
starts.</p>

<p>Much attention has been paid to the subject of registers,
more probably than to any other feature of the
vocal action. For a long time it was considered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
each register of the voice must be trained separately
and controlled in a special way. Various statements
have been made by laryngoscopic observers as to the
number of the registers and the actions of the vocal
cords in each one.</p>

<p>At present the leading authorities recognize three
registers, chest, medium, and head, corresponding to
the lower, middle, and higher parts of the range of the
voice. Individual voices vary in their possession of
registers. Tenors usually have only the medium and
head, the falsetto (confined generally to this voice)
being in most cases of too effeminate a quality for use
in artistic singing. Baritones usually have all three
registers, basses only chest and medium. Sopranos
may possess all three, although the chest register is
seldom well developed in this voice. Mezzos have the
chest and medium, and in the majority of cases the
head register also. Contraltos possess the chest and
medium, but very rarely the head register.</p>

<p>Teachers have in most cases discarded the plan of
giving precise limits to the registers and training them
separately. It is considered the best practice to bring
about the correct action of the medium part of the
voice, including command of the crescendo and diminuendo
on the single tone, before beginning to develop
the higher and lower portions of the range. The compass
is then gradually extended upward and downward,
care being taken to avoid the breaks which almost
always resulted from the older system of training
the registers separately.</p>

<p>Assistance is found in developing the low notes by
the cultivation of chest resonance. High notes are
helped by the use of nasal resonance and also by practice
in attacking tones with the liquid or sonant consonants.
Both these topics will be considered later.</p>

<p>Three resonance cavities have to be brought under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
control, each of which acts independently of the others.
These are the chest, the mouth-pharynx, and the nasal
cavities. As a rule the influence of chest resonance is
most marked in the lower part of the voice. The
mouth-pharynx (in addition to its almost exclusive
province of vowel and consonant formation) reinforces
the entire range, and the nasal cavities contribute most
to the high notes.</p>

<p>It must not be understood, however, that in artistic
singing chest resonance is to be used only on low notes
and nasal resonance on high notes. The special function
of nasal resonance is believed to be the imparting
of brilliancy, point, and carrying power to the tones.
While its effect is more marked on the high notes, it
must always be present in some degree throughout the
entire compass of the voice. Breadth and sonority of
tone are supposed to be contributed by chest resonance,
and these must also be present on all loud tones,
whether high, medium, or low.</p>

<p>Yet as brilliancy and point are more native to the
high notes, nasal resonance is always more marked in
this part of the voice. In the same way the qualities
of tone due to chest resonance belong more properly to
the lower and middle tones. On the practical side this
is of great importance. It is vastly more easy to secure
command of each form of resonance first in that part
of the voice to which it is native. When this has been
done it is a comparatively simple matter to extend this
command higher or lower as the case may be.</p>

<p>It is the usual practice to begin instruction in the
management of resonance with the mouth-pharynx
cavity. For this purpose exercises on the vowel <em>ah</em> are
generally first used. The position assumed by the
tongue for this vowel is peculiarly favorable for securing
an expansion of the lower part of the mouth-pharynx
cavity. An increase in the size of this cavity
is sought for the purpose of bringing about a corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
increase in the volume and power of the
tone.</p>

<p>While not directly a feature of mouth-pharynx resonance
strictly speaking, the emission of the tone is
usually treated under this head. After being generated
by the vibration of the vocal cords, the tone is to be
directed to the front of the mouth, in such manner that
it impinges on the hard palate, just above the upper
front teeth. This has for its purpose the freeing of the
tone from the vocal cords and the bringing of it forward
in the mouth, so as to secure the effect of ‘forward
tone’ advocated by the old masters.</p>

<p>For acquiring the effect of forward tone, studies are
also used on tones begun with certain labial and lingual
consonants. Exercises are given on single tones
on such syllables as <em>bah</em>, <em>bee</em>, <em>boo</em>—<em>ma</em>, <em>mee</em>, <em>mo</em>—<em>la</em>,
<em>lee</em>, <em>lo</em>, etc. These are practised on notes covering a
range of about one octave. Similar exercises are used
for obtaining command of nasal resonance. For this
purpose the consonant <em>n</em> is especially favored and
exercises are used on syllables such as <em>na</em>, <em>nee</em>, <em>no</em>, etc.</p>

<p>Another means of acquiring command of the several
forms of resonance is found in certain characteristic
sensations which the singer experiences in singing tones
of the various types. A tone strongly marked by nasal
resonance awakens a sensation of tingling in the forehead
and upper nose. A pronounced feeling of vibration
in the upper chest, particularly in the region of the
breast bone, accompanies the right use of chest resonance.
The ‘forward’ tone is characterized by similar
sensations in the front of the mouth. When practising
exercises for acquiring command of resonance
the student is instructed to feel the appropriate sensations,
thus bringing the tone into the proper position.</p>

<p>Each form of resonance is particularly favored by
certain vowels. <em>Oo</em> and <em>oh</em> lend themselves most readily
to the acquirement of chest resonance. <em>Ee</em> facilitates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span> in
bringing in nasal resonance, while <em>ah</em> is the
easiest vowel for obtaining command of the open
throat and the forward tone, the most important functions
of mouth-pharynx resonance.</p>

<p>Two marked forms of faulty tone production often
call for special means of correction. These are the
throaty and the unpleasantly nasal tone. For the cure
of throaty production relaxing exercises are generally
used. Sighing and yawning on the vowel <em>ah</em> with a
free expiration furnish the basis of these exercises.
Single tones and descending scale passages are practised
in this manner, the breath being allowed to rush
out freely and without control. Other directions are
frequently given for the correction of throatiness.
These include instruction in the support of the tone,
the throat being relieved of pressure by a steady and
controlled expiration. Bringing the tone forward in
the mouth in the manner already described assists in
this operation.</p>

<p>An excessive or a faulty use of nasal resonance is
looked upon as the cause of the unpleasantly nasal
tone. Too great a degree of relaxation of the muscles
of the soft palate may bring about this condition. The
means most favored for the correction of this fault are,
first, muscular exercise in raising and lowering the
soft palate, which gives a better tonicity to these muscles;
and, second, the imparting of the correct idea of
nasal resonance in the manner already described.</p>

<p>Another frequent fault of production, the tremolo,
may result from any one of several causes. A lack of
breath control may cause the expiratory pressure on
the vocal cords to be unregulated and intermittent.
Faulty methods of breathing, particularly those in
which the upper chest is allowed to collapse at the
start of the expiration, may lead to a flabby or ‘wobbly’
condition of the muscles which hold the larynx in
place. A lack of support for the tone may result from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the column of vocalized breath being directed backward,
instead of toward its proper point of impact on
the roof of the mouth.</p>

<p>For the cure of the tremolo the teacher must analyze
in each individual case and locate the seat of the
trouble. When this has been pointed out the fault is
eradicated by applying the appropriate instruction—controlling
the breath properly, placing the tone in the
correct position in the mouth, etc.</p>

<p>A clear enunciation of the text is indispensable in
artistic singing. This is in one sense not a feature of
tone production strictly speaking. It is possible to
enunciate with perfect distinctness and yet to use the
voice very badly, as is seen in the case of many vaudeville
singers. On the other hand, a correct production
of tone may be exhibited by a singer whose enunciation
is too indistinct to be understood. Yet it is the duty of
the vocal teacher to train his pupils in the clear delivery
of words, as well as in the other elements of the art
of singing.</p>

<p>Special exercises and drills in the articulation of the
various consonants are not widely used. Experience
has shown that the same end can be attained, with
vastly less of drudgery for the student, by paying attention
to clearness of pronunciation in the singing of
songs and exercises with words. Students sometimes
have difficulty with some one or two vowels or consonants.
In cases of this kind the master instructs the
pupil in the correct position of the tongue, lips, etc., for
the particular sound, and if necessary arranges special
exercises for the purpose.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>How long a time should be allotted to a course in
tone production along the lines just described it is not
easy to state definitely. Practices in this regard vary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
greatly among vocal teachers. One reason for this is
that tone production is seldom made the exclusive
topic of study for any great length of time. Students
of singing are generally eager to sing, and teachers are
therefore obliged to intersperse their instruction in
voice placing with songs and melodious vocalises. Another
reason is found in the fact that the musical education
of the student frequently devolves in great measure
upon the vocal teacher. A knowledge of music,
sufficient at least to enable the student to memorize
songs and arias and to sing them in time and in tune,
is absolutely necessary before the advanced education
in the singer’s art can be undertaken. When teachers
are called upon to impart instruction of this kind, part
of each lesson time must of course be used for the
purpose.</p>

<p>While a strict application of the principles of vocal
science would demand that the complete course in tone
production be covered before even the simplest songs
are attempted, this system is almost never carried out
logically. The first few lessons are usually devoted to
breathing and attack; from then on about half of each
lesson time is spent on voice placing and half on songs.
In the instruction given on the songs attention is paid
to the more strictly musical elements of singing—style,
delivery, interpretation, etc., as well as to the formation
of the tones. Technical exercises of progressive difficulty
are taken up about as soon as the student has
acquired sufficient vocal control to perform them. As
a rule there is no precise stage at which voice placing
work strictly speaking ceases and the technical training
of the voice is begun.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that any one teacher or vocal expert
has founded an authoritative school of vocal
science. There is not even anything in the nature of a
distinctively national school. Closely resembling
methods are followed in all European countries, as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
as in America. Every famous modern master has imparted
his principles to many students who in their
turn have become teachers. Yet it is rather rare for
any one to take up the profession of voice culture without
first receiving some instruction from several recognized
masters. This custom has resulted in a general
levelling of systems, each teacher selecting what he
considers best from all the methods which he investigates.
Meanwhile the old Italian method is still recognized
as possessing elements of great value, even in the
department of tone production, in which its principles
are so imperfectly understood by the scientifically disposed
teacher. The great majority of teachers seek to
apply some of the principles of the old method, notably
its oral traditions, which were discussed a few pages
back, in conjunction with the practices of vocal
science.</p>

<p>Modern voice culture cannot be believed to have
reached its final development. Even the most conscientious
advocates of the scientific doctrines feel that
there is a certain lack of completeness in present methods.
Investigations are still being carried on in the
various topics of vocal science. It is possible that the
near future will see important discoveries in the means
for control of laryngeal action and resonance. Some
authorities, on the other hand, look altogether in the
opposite direction. An abandonment of the doctrines
of vocal science and a return to the instinctive methods
of the old masters is favored by these teachers.</p>

<p>So far as the course of future events can be foretold,
it seems probable that a combination of the two methods,
now seemingly opposed, will eventually be brought
about. The scientific investigation of the voice has
brought to light so much of valuable truth that it would
be ridiculous to throw its results lightly aside. At the
same time the success of the old method proves that it
contained a satisfactory solution of all vocal problems.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
How the two methods will be fused into one it is
not now possible to say. But the only marked tendency
is in that direction. We are justified in the hope that
its accomplishment will not be long postponed.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>‘In this or that Sicilian hamlet,’ says the Countess
Martinengo-Cæsaresco in her ‘Essays in the Study of
Folk-Songs,’ ‘there is a man known by the name of “the
Poet,” or perhaps “the Goldfinch.” He is completely
illiterate and belongs to the poorest class; he is a blacksmith,
a fisherman, or a tiller of the soil. If he has the
gift of improvisation, his fellow-villagers have the satisfaction
of hearing him applauded by the Great Public—the
dwellers in all the surrounding hamlets assembled
at the fair on St. John’s Eve. Or it may be he
is of a meditative turn of mind, and makes his poetry
leisurely as he lies full length under the lemon-trees
taking his noontide rest. Should you pass by, it is unlikely
he will give himself the trouble of lifting his
eyes. He could not say the alphabet to save his life;
but the beautiful earth and skies and sea which he has
looked on every day since he was born have taught him
some things not learnt in school. The little poem he
has made in his head is indeed a humble sort of poetry,
but it is not unworthy of the praise it gets from the
neighbors who come dropping into his cottage door,
uninvited, but sure of a friendly welcome next Sunday
after mass, their errand being to find out if the rumor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
is true that “the Goldfinch” has invented a fresh <em>canzuna</em>?
Such is the peasant poet of to-day; such he was
five hundred or a thousand years ago.’</p>

<p>Here is the original singer. He has existed all over
the world in every age, probably, since civilization began
to dawn. We are very wrong in thinking of songs
as normally written by special composers and sung by
special singers in concert halls. Such a situation is
not the usual but the unusual one. For, generally
speaking, it is not special people who are singers but
ordinary people. Artists have been in the habit of
thinking that the world is divided into ordinary men
and artists. William Morris startled them by declaring
that ordinary men <em>are</em> artists—that to be artistic is the
normal condition of ordinary men. It is only our materialistic
civilization, he said, that has made men inartistic.
And historically, at least, he is quite right. It
is only in recent times, and in certain nations, that it
has come to be regarded as unusual that an ordinary
man should be a singer. In all other ages, we may
safely say, and in nearly all nations, it was regarded as
unusual that an ordinary man should <em>not</em> be a singer.
Singing has always been as natural to man as running,
or whistling, or making love. It is only in these latter
times that a man who sings for the joy of it is thought
‘queer.’</p>

<p>The songs that have been written down on paper
are of course only the smallest fraction of those that
have been invented. It is a very unusual adventure
for a song to get written down on paper. Not one out
of a thousand experiences it. Most songs are ‘made
up’ by some ordinary person at work or at play, remembered
and repeated, imitated by some one else
and changed a little and passed on. They live from
mouth to mouth and in the hearts of people. Every nation,
until it became too lettered and too self-conscious,
had its songs of this kind, many of them beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
enough to be known by thousands of people, some the
property of only a few. In Italy investigators have recently
noted down thousands of songs that never
touched paper before, but they were only a tiny part
of the songs that were passing from mouth to mouth.
So it has been in every country. Greenland and Iceland
have their songs which originated no one knows
where or when. We possess folk-songs of China, Japan,
and India. The phonograph has noted down hundreds
of songs of the North American Indians. And
every country in Europe has yielded songs innumerable.</p>

<p>We should be on our guard, then, against assuming
that what we know as ‘song literature’—the songs written
by composers in their study and printed on paper
before being sung—is any very considerable part of
the song music of the world. It is merely the music
chiefly at the disposal of highly educated people—principally
because it is <em>printed</em>. And from a certain
standpoint—that of the school-trained musician—it is
perhaps the ‘greatest’ vocal music. But remember that
the standpoint of the school-trained musician is only
one standpoint. The conscious composer has chosen to
look at his musical materials in a certain way and to
judge the result accordingly. But by another test his
work is inferior; in its power to move thousands of
human hearts no song by Schubert or Schumann or
Brahms can begin to equal ‘Auld Lang Syne’ or ‘The
Marseillaise.’ Of necessity this book will be chiefly
concerned with consciously composed ‘art’ music. But
we should always remember that this is only because
art music represents the great majority of all the music
that has been noted down—and of course in a measure
art songs at their best contain in a sublimated form the
elements of folk-song.</p>

<p>The less civilized and conscious people are, the more
readily they do their own singing. There is little spontaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
song among us to-day and yet we can occasionally
hear a workman humming an aimless tune
under his breath. This was probably the normal state
of things when men were less educated. Everybody
was a composer, partly because it was easier to make
up your own song than to remember somebody else’s.
Among the Indians songs were regarded in some tribes
as the personal property of the person who invented
them and were not to be sung by any one else unless
that second person had acquired the rights in it by gift
or inheritance. But generally, as people became somewhat
more advanced, songs were freely appropriated
from one singer to another. And each singer who borrowed
generally added something of his own to the
song—something to express his sense of beauty or artistic
fitness: a more effective phrasing here, or a simpler
group of notes there. Sometimes the song was so
popular that it passed from tribe to tribe, or from nation
to nation. In this case each people gave its individuality
to the song, adding perhaps a little ornamentation
if its nature was gay and volatile, or making the
melody more regular and balanced if its soul was
earnest and contemplative. Everywhere the races, the
nations, and the tribes have shown their souls to us in
their songs.</p>

<p>We must not suppose that these songs, which were so
highly treasured, were elaborate. Sometimes they
were made of no more than two or three tones of the
scale. In thousands of songs there are no more than
five tones and certain octave reduplications (as, for
instance, in ‘Auld Lang Syne’). In most cases the more
primitive popular songs are too simple to make any
impression upon us at all. But often that is our fault
and not theirs. Our taste has been somewhat spoiled
by highly seasoned food. After a little sympathetic
study of primitive songs we find them full of eloquence
and pathos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>But whether or not the early songs would please us
now, they were of incalculable importance in the lives
of early peoples. We are inclined to regard singing
as an amusement only. We forget that it once had a
practical importance that is hardly to be equalled by
any single institution in modern life. Men were shut
up within valleys, or tied by their work to the fields.
It was by singing and poetry that they became citizens
of the world. For, before the days of newspapers and
postal service, it was the wandering bards who took
the news from city to city, from court to court, from
nation to nation. They served as historians, recording
in verse the great events of their own nation and others,
and passing the record down to succeeding generations.
They served as public libraries, conserving the legend
and sentiment of nations for the reference of others.
More, they conserved the teaching of religious seers, the
great unwritten laws of the nation, from fathers to
children. In short, all that passed between nation and
nation, and between generation and generation, was
transmitted in song.</p>

<p>We wonder, of course, why these things happened in
song, rather than in plain prose. But the answer is
simple: verse is easier to remember than prose. All
the stories, all the laws, all the culture of the nation
had to be <em>remembered</em>. People’s memories served instead
of libraries. And with such a mass of matter to
remember, people developed memories which are almost
unbelievable to-day. To retain the equivalent of
hundreds of pages of prose was of course impossible.
But once throw the matter into verse and the remembering
of it, to a primitive man, became comparatively
simple. The whole of the Iliad and Odyssey were
transmitted in this way through at least three centuries
before they were committed to writing. For verse
somehow remembers itself; the sound remains even
after the sense is gone. Prof. G. L. Kittredge, of Harvard,
tells of some literary investigators in the Orient,
who came upon a blind beggar. They asked him to recite
poetry, and he started on a long epic of which he
knew thousands of lines. It was not in the language of
the time, but an old and strange tongue. They asked
him what the lines meant. He did not know. He had
heard them from his father, and had remembered them
by the sound.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was, then, of the highest importance that all knowledge
that was to be preserved be cast in metrical form.
A wandering minstrel was able to tell one country
about the battles of another country by making a song
about them. The nature of the Gods and the religious
duties of men could be preserved for succeeding centuries
because Homer made a poem out of them. And
so poetry was a thing of incalculable value.</p>

<p>In these practical matters, of course, the music was
not of the same importance as the words. We do not
know, in fact, to what extent music entered into the
reciting of the old poems. But it has been conjectured
that even the longest poems, like the Iliad, were usually
intoned and rose into something like a set melody
in the more impassioned parts. Certainly the shorter
poems always tended to find a tune for themselves. It
is even quite likely that the bards invented words and
tune at the same time. The long Robin Hood poems of
England were usually sung and not spoken and we
possess some of the curious tunes with which they were
traditionally associated. Among the earlier minstrels
much of the music was improvised in the course of the
recitation, though as the poems became old and widely
spread it is likely that they were associated with precise
melodies or melodic motives. On the whole, it
seems that little of the metrical literature antedating
the art of writing was without music of one sort or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
another. All early references, however, tend to regard
the tune and the words as one and the same thing. It
seems to some, therefore, since melody is not mentioned
by itself, that music was of slight importance.
But the truth seems rather to be that the melody was
inseparable from the words and not to be thought of
apart from them. And the music seems to have been
of the highest importance in giving dignity and seriousness
to the poem.</p>

<p>What the music of the earliest poems was like we
have no exact means of guessing. The writing of musical
notes is of comparatively late invention and
there was no way to preserve the old tunes through the
changing centuries. When the traditional poems were
committed to writing the sacred marriage of verse and
music usually ended in a divorce. We have, however,
a Finnish melody of great age, sung to an epic fragment,
which might be taken as typical. It consists of
few notes (which can safely be said of nearly all primitive
tunes), but the stanza is long and the winding
melodic line is highly expressive. But in general we
cannot hope to know the earliest melodies of the European
nations. We can fumble our way back about
a thousand years and then we are met by the blackness
of mystery.</p>

<p>But we know that the songs were there and that they
gave to little lives the opportunity of being big. We
find it hard to realize how important they were, now
that telegraph wires have connected all parts of the
world, when a message can be sent from San Francisco
to Moscow and back in a day, when all that has happened
the world over (and much besides) is spread
out before us on paper at our breakfast tables the next
morning, when all knowledge is classified and published
and can be found in any good public library.
Imagine yourself living in a village or working on a
farm without these things. It is a day’s walk to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
next village. The next country lies beyond the mountains
and there are no passes over, and besides there
would be no way of living if you left your work, unless
you went as a pilgrim. Every year a few young men
wander away seeking their fortunes and never come
back. Every year a few men come seeking their fortunes
and stay. One or two men have wandered the
world and come back home, telling wonderful incoherent
tales of what happens beyond the mountains.
But this is all the news you get beyond the gossip of
your town and the country around—except that once
in a while comes a wandering minstrel or juggler with
tricks and songs. He will tell you the political fortunes
of the next kingdom and whether its king is
likely to go to war with your king and whether you
will thus be forced to serve in the army. He will tell
you the gossip and scandal of the courts. He will tell
you the customs of other people and will give you practical
hints that may save you trouble in your work.
And, best of all, he will tell you new stories to vary the
monotony of the village gossip. So you will spend a
wonderful afternoon listening to him in the village
square, and when he is gone you will have something
to think and talk about for weeks to come.</p>

<p>Thus the wandering singers served as newspapers.
And their best songs were remembered and repeated
(and improved upon) to serve as history from that time
on. But history might also be made in another way.
The skalds of the northern races accompanied their
chiefs on their battles in order to sing of them afterwards.
But they were there as historians, not merely
as poets. ‘Ye shall be here that ye may see with your
own eyes what is achieved this day,’ King Olaf is recorded
to have told his skalds on the eve of the battle
of Stiklastad (1030), ‘and have no occasion, when ye
shall afterward celebrate these actions in song, to depend
on the reports of others.’ The skalds were there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
that is, as true witnesses of the events, as the specialized
repositories of historical information. We cannot suppose
that their reports were altogether truthful. They
were doubtless expected to ‘forget’ many things that
might seem inglorious. But their songs often passed to
the people. And, if the king or chief had made a bad
record with them, be sure the songs became changed in
people’s mouths to show him in his true character.
And very often the people, or their own singers, made
the narrative songs themselves, dealing out praise or
blame by their own justice without fear or favor.</p>

<p>In religion song was a matter of the highest importance,
as it has always been. A prophet might reveal
the will of the gods, but, unless he were a poet or had
a poet to help him, he could not make people remember
it. And so in all primitive races the priests were
poets and musicians. By the beauty and impressiveness
of their songs they proved their right to interpret
the divine will. And only in poems could they preserve
their doctrine for their successors. But in time the
priests generally had to give up their prestige to those
who were first of all poets and singers. The gods of
Greece were interpreted and made known to the people
by the poets. The Teutonic and Norse gods were
made known in the epics and sagas. No one else spoke
to the people with the same religious conviction as the
poet. And so the poets have always, until the most
recent times, partaken of a certain religious sanctity.
Dante and Milton served as interpreters of religion to
their fellow creatures—as beings set apart ‘to justify
the ways of God to men.’</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Thus song, then, was the chief agent of civilization to
primitive man. All that is supplied in our lives by
railroads, telegraph lines, telephones, newspapers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
books, and libraries was supplied to primitive peoples
by song. But this still represents only half the value of
song. If it gave to primitive men all the practical service
which specialized inventions are rendering to us,
it also gave them the romance and beauty which we
have largely lost from our lives. Every simple, primitive
person, we have said, sings—either his own song
or his neighbor’s. We have in great abundance the
records of what their songs were about. The subjects
cover nearly the whole range capable of artistic treatment,
but chiefly the great human experiences—love,
pity, nature, death, the supernatural.</p>

<p>Slowly, after much imitating and experimenting,
men learned to sing their feelings. This achievement
was so important that there is hardly another one to
be compared with it. For the growth of civilization has
been simply the growth in men of consciousness—consciousness
of themselves and their surroundings. And
every new song that men were able to make for themselves
marked a new step in consciousness. To us it
seems quite obvious that a deer, for instance, has four
legs. But the fact is obvious only as everything else is
obvious when it is really looked at. The great difficulty
is to get people to <em>look</em> at things. And it was probably
a real (and most important) discovery when the primitive
huntsman realized that the deer he had been hunting
had four legs, and not three or five. He simply
hadn’t thought about the matter before. He hadn’t observed
clearly. Now he had added one more fact about
life to his mental treasure house. He had become one
more degree clearly conscious.</p>

<p>Now, art has been the chief agent of this advancing
consciousness through the centuries. Our huntsman
perhaps never thought about the number of the deer’s
legs until he tried to draw the deer with a bone knife
on the wall of his cave. But when he had to <em>create</em>
the deer in a work of art then he <em>had</em> to come to clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
consciousness about the matter. And the same is true
of every song that simple people have made. It necessitated
true observation. It forced its author to <em>see</em>.
It may seem childishly obvious to say in a song that
the bluebells are blue, but most people pay little attention
to the question. It is something to have thought
the fact worth mentioning.</p>

<p>But it was much more. It was not only an increase
in consciousness. It was an increase in experience.
By singing over his little song about the bluebell the
peasant enjoyed the bluebell a second time in his imagination.
It is nothing against the song that the blueness
of the bluebell is obvious. Most of the beautiful
things in life are obvious but nevertheless go unrecognized.
The important thing about the song is that
somebody enjoyed the blueness of the bluebell so much
that he had to sing about it.</p>

<p>The great use of these personal songs to people was
that it helped them to feel at home in the world. ‘The
first poet of human things,’ says the Countess Martinengo-Cæsaresco,
‘was perhaps one who stood in the
presence of death. In the twilight that went before
civilization the loves of men were prosaic and intellectual
unrest was remote, but there was already Rachel
weeping for her children and would not be comforted
because they are not.’ Death as a mystery was a horror
too great to be borne. But death made into a song
could be looked at and in some degree known. The
awful sense of helplessness as people stood beside a
fresh grave was alleviated by their singing of their
grief. When the mystery had become incarnated in a
work of art they could face it and know who their
enemy was.</p>

<p>Every man who feels emotions craves expression of
them. The ability to express is perhaps what separates
man from the animals. The man who cannot achieve
the expression of what he feels sinks back into a spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
numbness in which joy and sorrow are of less
importance. But the man who is able to see the things
that are within him and about him—to see them clearly
enough to express them in songs—is able to take his
place in life and go on to more consciousness and more
power.</p>

<p>Something like this is the service songs have performed
to men’s souls. But, most of all, of course, songs
have taught men how to love. As men began to realize
that love must be more than a mere blind craving they
had to answer the question: ‘How much do I love her?
How do I love her?’ And the question had to be answered
in some kind of concrete terms. One old
French lover says in his song that if King Henry gave
to him the town of Paris on condition that he give up
the love of his sweetheart, he would reply to Henry the
King: ‘Take back your town of Paris; I love my sweetheart
more, heigh-ho, I love my sweetheart more.’ And
when we read the fine straightforward old French in
which the song is sung we know that he meant it. It is
evident that the whole estate of love and marriage has
risen to a vastly higher level when the lover, instead of
saying, ‘I want my sweetheart,’ can sing, ‘I want my
sweetheart more than I want the town of Paris.’ So
songs gave to life definite meanings and values.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In the beginning, as we have said, it is probable that
everybody made songs for himself. Helen Vacaresco
noted a long song improvised by a Roumanian peasant
woman who was going mad; the woman was suffering
under a great sorrow and was trying to express it.
Being simple and without knowledge or fear of artistic
forms and laws, she was able to express it. And each
day she wandered in the fields singing the song she
had composed, changing it little by little. It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
made for the sake of making a song, but for the sake
of expressing her sorrow. It was, of course, only half
a song and a half a mechanical repetition of her troubles.
But it had its beauty of word and something like
a set melody; it was an emotion objectified, put into a
work of art where it could be looked at and known.</p>

<p>Here was song at its very earliest beginning. It was
spontaneous, it was personal, it was utterly sincere.
And, because it sought some objective form, it was a
primitive work of art. We may imagine the earliest
songs starting in just this way. Perhaps this Roumanian
peasant woman had her counterpart thousands of
years ago. Her song, or part of it, was heard and imitated
by others who felt the same sorrow. It was
changed in passing from mouth to mouth. Needless
words were dropped, weak expressions were strengthened.
As men became able to look more clearly at their
trouble the essential things in the song were emphasized
or put in a more emphatic position. Everything
was dropped from it that did not express the very
heart of the emotion. The lines perhaps became more
rhythmical; the verses began to balance and contrast
with each other; the metaphors became more brilliant
or more precise. Soon all members of the tribe knew
it, and when the young men wandered away to other
lands they took the song with them.</p>

<p>At the same time a similar perfecting process was
going on in the music. The original melody was perhaps
little more than a chant of two or three notes, the
tune rising when the emotional pitch was raised and
dropping when the movement became more calm. The
tune was at first not thought of as a thing in itself.
But gradually people became conscious of the two or
three notes in their relation and succession. And they
began to make them more varied, to express the
changes of emotion more accurately. The melody became
divided into stanzas and lines corresponding with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the words and showed in itself where the thought came
to a partial stop and where it began again. Then people
began to notice peculiar figures which they had
unconsciously put into the melody. They made use of
these, balancing or contrasting them to add beauty to
the tune. And gradually the melody came to have
beauty and meaning of its own.</p>

<p>This series of changes perhaps occupied centuries,
for the artistic power of primitive men advances very
slowly. The singers had not yet thought of putting
this song in rhythm; and it was yet many centuries before
they would feel anything like a musical scale.
Rhythm had probably developed among people as a
thing in itself, not directly connected with musical
tones. Rhythmic movement is common to all men—in
walking, in running, and in the beating of the heart.
Dancing must have arisen spontaneously from an excess
of emotion. Such dancing was perhaps accompanied
by the clapping of hands, the beating of sticks,
or the pounding of some primitive drum. Then with
the invention of some primitive musical instrument the
tribal musician began to play a simple dance tune in
rhythm, a tune of two notes, at first an aimless shifting
from one note to another, and later an organized melody
with tonal figures and balances and contrasts.</p>

<p>It is probable that these two elements—rhythm and
melody—were developed separately and were at first
regarded as separate arts. At least it seems certain
that singing was at first without rhythm. It must have
been a wonderful day when somebody thought of combining
the two—of singing the old song with metre
and accents. But this, too, must have developed very
slowly, being at first no more than an accenting of each
alternative note. At the same time the song had probably
been divided into line divisions. The singer then
probably developed his rhythm from both ends, so to
speak, building a more complex series of accents from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
the single group of two notes, and at the same time
subdividing the line into sections. After several more
centuries, perhaps, the tribe possessed a song that was
fairly metrical and regular.</p>

<p>All this time the notion of a scale—a set succession
of notes from which the notes of the tune were to be
chosen—was entirely lacking. It came comparatively
late in musical development, though it is the first incident
in musical <em>history</em>. At first each melody was its
own scale. Then, as people began to observe similarities
in the tone relations between several melodies,
they began to have a conception of the regular succession
of tones which was common to all of them. Such
a succession, a mode or primitive scale, was of but
three or four notes. By arranging the semi-tones several
new scales could be formed. And by here and
there adding a note above or below the scales could
be enlarged.</p>

<p>With the enlargement of the scales melodies became
enlarged in range. More opportunities arose for the
balancing and contrasting of melodic devices. The
tune became more complex, more regular, and more
beautiful.</p>

<p>It was now several centuries since the song had first
come into existence. Since that time it had undergone
perhaps a dozen transformations, each so unlike the
other that nobody would have suspected they had any
relation. But they were different forms of one and
the same song. For songs have ancestors and descendants
just as men do. Our song may have had a numerous
progeny. As it passed from one province to another
certain phrases of the melody lingered in people’s
minds and found their way into other songs. Perhaps
a line or two of its words became common property
and were used as the refrain for a new song. Certainly
as people made other songs they perforce made them
somewhat in the image of the great ancestor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Thus for centuries—ten, twenty, or thirty, likely as
not—the song was growing and changing, or at least
giving birth to children before dying by the wayside.
And folk-songs are still alive, growing and changing.
It seems possible that the years of their natural life
may be numbered, for it is becoming harder every year
for them to live in their new environment. But they
are still in the land of the living and may continue for
centuries to come, and if so they are bound to continue
to grow and change. Thirty centuries of growth have
not taken place that songs may stop growing right here.
Perhaps the songs of to-day may seem as crude to people
five hundred years hence as the songs of five hundred
years ago seem to us now.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>We must always remember that songs of every kind
are primarily composed in the spirit of this typical
folk-song. Even the most learned composer is spiritually
a descendant of the crazy Roumanian peasant
woman, and his songs, if they are real songs at all,
are of the same spontaneous kind as hers. However
much he may be occupied with conscious scholastic
principles, if his music does not somehow sing in this
natural, artless vein it is but as sounding brass and
tinkling cymbal. The impulse to song is the soul of
all true songs the world over.</p>

<p>What this impulse is has occupied the minds of
theorists for many a year. Their explanations are
perhaps not important, since whatever their conclusions
we still posses the wonderful song literature
which is at our disposal. But their theories are at
least interesting, if only to prove that song, like love,
is one of those human things that can never be utterly
explained.</p>

<p>Primitive people almost invariably attribute music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
to divine agency. We know the story of Orpheus, who
moved the beasts and even the rocks and trees to tears
by his sweet singing. We know also the story of the
competition of Apollo the harp player and Marsyas the
flute player. The Chinese say that they obtained their
musical scale from a miraculous bird. The legend is
interesting as showing how people tend to invent a
supernatural explanation for the artificial laws which
are felt to need some sort of superstitious bolstering
up. For it is recorded in Chinese history that this scale
has several times been changed by edict of the emperor,
who considers an orthodox scale a very important
thing to insist upon and wishes to have his word
accepted as divine law. The Japanese tradition is that
the sun-goddess once retired into a cave and the gods
devised music to lure her forth once more. The story
suggests the practice of certain primitive tribes who
sing and dance during a solar eclipse, either to scare
away the evil spirits or to beg the sun-god back into
their midst. The Nahua Indians of North America
say that the god Tezcatlipoca sent for music from the
sun and made a bridge of whales and turtles by which
to convey it to the earth. The Abyssinians have a tale
to the effect that Yared transmitted music to men, the
holy spirit having appeared to him in the form of a
pigeon. But in the story of the Javans there seems to
be a kernel of scientific truth. They say that the earliest
music was suggested to them by the wind whistling
through a bamboo tube which had been left hanging
on a tree.</p>

<p>The theories of the earlier musical philosophers of
the nineteenth century were not so unlike these legends
as they seemed at the time. These men had a limited
historical outlook and were inclined to discredit, when
they did not ignore, the music preceding that of Palestrina,
just as the historians of painting before Ruskin’s
time tended to regard all Italian painting before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Raphael as mere experimental bungling. To these
earlier philosophers music was a thing <em>discovered</em>
rather than a thing <em>evolved</em>. In their view music had
always existed in a sort of secret treasure house instituted
by a beneficent creator for the edification of men.
All melodies and harmonies were piled in there awaiting
the explorations of musicians. The explorations
were undertaken by the ‘inspired’ artists, those who
had been endowed with finer ears and more daring
imaginations. All musical history was a story of the
development of music from its imperfect state among
the primitives to its perfect state with Beethoven. This
description may be exaggerated, but it is certain that
the earlier theorists considered music as a self-existent
thing, with its own laws and its own principles of
beauty—laws and principles which must be discovered
by the elect among artists instead of being evolved by
the peoples. As to the impulse to song and to artistic
creation in general they laid it to that mysterious thing,
‘inspiration.’</p>

<p>Schopenhauer’s theory has a modern ring and is excellent
poetry even though it can hardly rank as science.
He says that while the other arts—painting,
sculpture, and architecture—represent the Idea, which
is the reflection of the Will, music represents the Will
itself. It is pure energy, the nearest thing that exists
among men to the essence of reality.</p>

<p>With Darwin all this kind of speculation changed
and the theories of musical origins became more a matter
of biology than of music. Darwin traced the impulse
to song to the love-making of animals and primitive
man. He showed how in Nature beauty is continually
being made the adjunct and servant of love—how
the bird sings or the insect dances to attract its
mate. Many theorists have sought to explain the whole
of art as originating in the sexual impulse. But in this
theory, as in all, there are data on both sides of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
question and the explanation is interesting rather than
valuable.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer pursues the same biological line.
But he traces the impulse to song from the surplus
of energy in living things. Nature, as we know, is
prodigal, producing thousands of eggs or seeds where
she expects only scores of insects or plants to grow.
And so she gives to each living thing more energy than
is needed to keep it alive and healthy—or at least more
energy than is needed <em>all the time</em>. With this surplus
of energy something must be done. And that something
among men is art. When a wild rose-bush is
put in rich soil it grows a double rose and a larger one.
And so, when a man has a little more than enough for
his material needs, he attempts to decorate and beautify
his surroundings. To Spencer the typical example
of nascent art is the child who dances out of pure
joy of life. But others object to this, saying that this
dancing of the child (and all similarly spontaneous
art) is lacking in the very quality which makes art—namely,
discipline and control. It is selection and control,
they say, which makes any work of art more than
a mere daub of color or conglomeration of sounds.</p>

<p>Certainly the biological theories have not satisfactorily
explained the second great element in artistic
creation—the impulse to refinement. We have seen
that once our typical folk-song was invented by the
Roumanian peasant woman it could not stay as it was,
but had to take new forms, changing continually, and,
as we see it, usually for the better. What is it that
makes men dissatisfied with a crude, formless melody
and desirous of making it regular and organic? Perhaps
it is no more than the impulse to play which
children show when they arrange pebbles in new and
strange shapes on the sand or savages when they daub
their faces with new colors of war-paint. Again the
surplus of energy? Perhaps. Perhaps when people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
have become familiar with their primitive melody they
notice a peculiar turn of the phrase and take pleasure
in seeing what they can <em>do</em> with it in the way of repeating
it and inventing contrasting phrases. At any
rate, there it is, this impulse to refinement, more mystery
for the theorist and more entertainment for the
music lover.</p>

<p>On the whole, these theories probably err in trying
to simplify the case too much. More likely music has
not one simple <em>cause</em>, but many interacting <em>causes</em>.
Like every individual man whose ancestors are a multitude,
song must be the result of many, many causes.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>We have been speaking chiefly of the folk-song, the
fountain of all vocal music. But the art-song, that is,
the song for a solo voice with instrumental accompaniment,
which is quantitively but a small part of vocal
music, is the special study of this book. For convenience
we date the beginning of this art-song from Schubert,
regarding the song writers who preceded him as
mere experimenters. Accordingly, at the time of the
writing of this book the art-song, one of the four or five
great divisions of modern music, is hardly a century
old.</p>

<p>It is, of course, a somewhat arbitrary division that
separates the art-song from song as a whole. The arbitrary
division is justified by its convenience. Schubert
may fairly be said to have infused a new spirit
into song writing and most of the songs written by
established composers since his time have been written
in his spirit. So we find an extensive and remarkably
homogeneous song literature, the product of the
last hundred years, which in its form and intent separates
itself from the folk-song. The songs on the
boundary line are few. The songs before Schubert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
which give any evidence of this recent spirit are hardly
to be found at all. It is as though a new god had descended
from the skies and taught a new kind of art
to his creatures.</p>

<p>What is this distinction we draw between the folk-song
and the art-song? The superficial elements of
contrast are apt to be misleading, for, while most folk-songs
are simple, many art-songs are simple, too; and,
while many art-songs are irregular and peculiar, their
irregularities are rarely so great as are to be found
in the earlier folk-songs. The distinction must be
sought in the spirit of the songs. It becomes more eloquent
the more we study the two sorts. It forces us
continually to seek further back for the true character
of each, so that at last it seems as though we needed
two different souls for the singing of them. The folk-song
speaks for man in the mass; the art-song speaks for
man the individual. For the folk-song, let us always
remember, was composed not by an individual, but by
a mass, each member of which may have contributed
one or more of its beauties. If it had sung of a joy
or sorrow which belonged exclusively to its original
singer, it would have held no interest for other people
and would have died with its composer. Those folk-songs
were, of course, most popular which spoke for
the interests and emotions of the greatest number of
men. We can justly say that those folk-songs are greatest
which sing of the things that are common to all
men in such a way that they can be understood by all
men. But in the composition of the art-song precisely
the opposite influences are dominant. The composer,
if he is to make his mark in the art world, must not
write exactly like other composers, but must distinguish
his work in some way. He must call attention to himself
or his work by writing in a style that is not quite
like anybody else’s. Fashionable or critical audiences
will pay little attention to the man who seems merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
to be repeating what a greater man has written before
him; these audiences continually crave a novelty or a
sensation. Everything forces the conscious composer
in these days to be as personal as possible. His song
then expresses the feelings of one individual in one
particular style.</p>

<p>It has always been a nice question of taste whether
one prefers to observe the type or the individual.
Would you have your love song one that could be sung
by every lover, high or low, or one that would ring
true for you alone? If you are quite honest you will
probably have to admit that you will swing from one
to the other from time to time. At times it will seem
vulgar that you should be rejoicing in precisely the
same sentiments as those which are sending the Italian
bootblack into a seventh heaven; your delicacy, your
sense of dignity will demand that your love be your
own, like no one else’s on earth. And, again, the precious
selfishness of cultivating your own soul with such
conscious care when it is such a tiny part of humanity—such
a reaction will make you praise heaven that
you and the bootblack can sing the same love song and
feel the same love.</p>

<p>However you feel about it the art-song has chosen
to specialize on individuals. Not only on individual
persons, but on particular feelings of those persons.
The folk-song expresses the type emotion—love, sorrow,
or patriotism; the art-song expresses some particular
shade or nuance of these emotions. The Scotch
folk-tune which we sing with Burns’s stirring words,
‘Scots Wha Hae,’ expresses magnificently the defiance
of patriotic bravery. It might be the song of anybody
facing odds in defense of his beliefs. Schubert’s song,
‘Courage,’ has exactly the same note of defiance, but, so
to speak, only a particular section of the great general
emotion. His defiance is that of a man broken down
with sorrow and misfortune, who in one superb moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
vows to conquer by pure force of will power—a
vow which we know is impossible of fulfillment. The
modern French composers are especially apt at catching
a particular delicate phase of a mood or emotion
and rendering it so that it would never be mistaken
for another phase, however much the two resembled
each other. Have you never caught yourself moodily
looking at the last glow from a sunset and wondered
whether you have ever had a moment just like that
before—a moment which the slightest change in the
things about you would have spoiled utterly? Such a
moment it is the delight of the art-song to portray; it
is almost unknown to the folk-song.</p>

<p>The folk-song, again, presents an emotion in its sum
total; the art-song presents it in its component parts.
With their capacity and zest for exactitude song composers
have continually, since Schubert’s time, given
more and more attention to accuracy of detail. In one
of the earliest of Schubert’s songs, ‘Gretchen at the
Spinning-wheel,’ the girl is musing of her lover while
she is spinning. The whirr of the spinning-wheel is
in the accompaniment and enframes the whole song.
But when the girl sighs, ‘And, ah, his kiss!’ Schubert
felt that she would surely not continue her mechanical
spinning. So he makes the whirring stop in the accompaniment
and in its place comes a lovely succession
of chords—one would say like a blush. Now a
folk-song would have paid no attention to such a detail.
It would have caught and probably caught with
wonderful accuracy the spirit of the whole song. But
the variation of mood in the words would not have
affected the music. It could not, because the folk-song,
unpublished and disseminated among many untrained
persons, must be easy to remember. It is accordingly
most often cast in a regular stanza form and the same
melody is repeated for each verse of the words, though
the heroine change therein from the noon of joy to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
midnight of sorrow. The great majority of art-songs,
therefore, are not written in stanza form, but follow
the words with specially adapted music from beginning
to end. (This is the so-called <em>durchkomponiertes
Lied</em>.) The form of the art-song tends to be free in
the extreme, while that of the folk-song is usually
strict and regular. In the art-song the tendency toward
exactitude of delineation sometimes goes to extremes.
The music tries to be just to each phrase, or even to
each word, and the song as a whole is lost in the details.
But in general the good art-song shows not only
the emotion as a whole, by means of its formal or
modal unity, but also the component parts of the emotion
placed side by side. We might say that the art-song
follows the impressionistic method of showing
the component colors on the canvas and letting the eye
blend them into the resultant, while the folk-song follows
the older method of mixing the components on the
palette and showing only the blended result to the eye.</p>

<p>The highest glory of the folk-song is to express what
unites men. The highest glory of the art-song is to express
what differentiates men. The folk-song includes;
the art-song selects. The folk-song is general; the art-song
precise. The folk-song tells of life as man found
it; the art-song tells of life as man made it.</p>

<p>Nearly everything that is distinctive of the art-song
involves conscious planning. However spontaneous
and unrestrained a <em>Lieder</em> singer may appear on the
concert platform, there is behind his or her interpretation
a whole conscious network of selection and rejection.
A good folk-song, as everyone has noticed, asks
for no intellectual comprehension—it ‘sings itself.’ But
an art-song rarely ‘sings itself.’ It must be <em>sung</em>. And
this is precisely one of the beauties of the art-song—the
feeling that it has been achieved by art, that it is
the working-out of somebody’s intention, that it has
been <em>personally</em> propelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>A good Lieder singer is like some weaver of a delicate
design in silk. Every crossing is planned and the
worker must not let a single thread slip through his
fingers. Every detail of a song must be understood
before it can be interpreted. This does not mean that
the singer must have a ‘reason’—a logical argument in
words—for everything done. Usually words and arguments
about a song only befuddle the artistic sense.
The song must be <em>understood</em> in musical terms—by
comparing each phrase with similar phrases in the
song, by trying different tempos, different phrasings,
different qualities of voice. To <em>understand</em> a song in
the musical sense is to know when you sing it that you
could have sung it in ten or in fifty other specific ways,
but that you chose to sing it exactly in <em>this</em> way. It requires
a great deal of attention to fix in your ear accurately
all the little beauties and peculiarities of the
melody, the distinctions contained in tiny variations
of tempo, and so on. The facts are all obvious in the
song, but they demand attention. So the process is
exactly that of the primitive folk-singer who noticed,
to his delight, that bluebells were blue and that the
deer had four legs. And, like the folk-singer, when
you have consciously noted a multitude of these obvious
facts you feel more at home in the world—you have
completed a step in your education.</p>

<p>If the singer is obliged carefully to select and reject,
he is only doing what the composer did before him.
For the song writer’s task is one that will test the
soundness of his musicianship and his art. The song
is short. It will probably be sung among a number of
other short songs. It has every chance of being forgotten.
The composer can waste no time. With little
or no preluding he must strike a melodic phrase that in
smallest compass is worth hearing and worth remembering.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
He has none of the opportunities of the symphonist
or the opera writer. He cannot lead up to his
chief theme with a long expressive orchestral crescendo.
He cannot introduce it at the moment when
his audience is keyed up and receptive over a tense
emotional story. If the melody of the song is not worth
the trouble, no amount of decoration can make it so.
If one phrase out of four in the song is good and the
rest mediocre, the song is as much a failure as though
it had no single bar of beauty. When the composer
has written his song, he has committed himself. He
stands exposed to the universe without protection, without
excuse. He has chosen the test with which genius
is tested—to be great within narrow limits. If his music
speaks to the heart it speaks in words of one syllable.</p>

<p>If the basic materials of a song are so simple, it is
evident that the misplacing of a single note is a very
serious error. The expressive phrase might have stood
in a dozen slightly different forms. It was a delicate
judgment and selection that chose exactly this one. The
phrase, if it is to express something of importance,
must suggest a great deal more than it can say. This
is the problem of the <em>lyric</em>—the personal song of the
emotions—whether in words or music. If a poet is
to express the whole tenderness and fury of love in
eight, twelve, or sixteen lines he must select just the
right details that will suggest the whole epic of love
that he did not write. The structure and the language
may be simple in the extreme. ‘My luv’ is like a red,
red rose,’ sings Burns in one of the most beautiful love
lyrics ever written. The poem is only a succession of
the simplest poetic figures, similes; impressive effects
of rhyme and metre are not to be found. But every
one of the similes is a masterpiece, suggesting in striking
manner the variety and extravagance of the lover’s
feelings. ‘My luv’ is like a melody that’s sweetly play’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
in tune,’ continues the poet. ‘As fair art thou, my bonnie
lass, so deep in luv’ am I’—and from this point the
imagery sweeps up and up with increasing majesty and
frenzy—‘And I will luv’ thee still, my dear, till a’ the
seas gang dry. Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear, and
the rocks melt wi’ the sun; Oh! I will luv’ thee still,
my dear, while the sands o’ life shall run.’ We can
imagine Milton building up a long and magnificent description,
in a whole blank verse canto, of the rocks
melting in the heat of the sun. But Burns dazzles our
imagination by just mentioning the gorgeous picture
and then pressing on to another.</p>

<p>The themes of a good song are like this. They picture
the heart of an emotion that might be made the
subject of an opera; they establish instantly a mood
that might dominate a movement of a symphony. They
picture one detail of the building and let it imply the
whole vast edifice.</p>

<p>Schumann, in the middle section of his song, <em>Widmung</em>,
has such a melody, one which leads us straight
to the centre of a mood as profound as one can find
in many symphonies:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe20" id="score-p96">

<p class="center">Du bust die Ruh’, du bist der Frieden etc.</p>

<p class="center ebhide p2b"><a href="images/score-p96.png">[PNG]</a>[<a href="music/score-p96.mp3">Listen</a>]</p>
 

<p>One can imagine Beethoven building a long, superb
movement out of this theme; the ’cellos would take it
over rich bass harmony, the counterpoint would grow
deeper and more complex, a grand crescendo of many
measures would lead to a climax with the brass; the
whole body of violins would take up the theme in unison;
it would be exchanged between the wood-winds
and strings; and the movement would fade away on
some magical effect with the theme in the high registers
of the violins. The theme is abundantly worth such
extended and serious treatment. Schumann uses it for
two lines and then returns to his original motive. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
his purpose had been to get the greatest possible effect
out of given materials, such a procedure would have
been criminal wastefulness. But his purpose was to
express the spirit of the words. So he used the theme
as the expression demanded, not begrudging a motive
which would have served him for a whole symphony
movement. And, thanks to this restraint, he made a
perfect song.</p>

<p>And the restraint which the composer showed in
using themes in naked simplicity must be reflected in
the delivery of the song by the singer. Conscious restraint
is foreign to the spirit of the folk-song, excepting
for the universal rule that every work of art must
show some reserve power. But in the art-song, artificed
as it is with conscious pains, reserve in the singer
is a virtue in itself. Unless one feels that every detail
of the delivery is firmly under control one has an uneasy
sense that the singer may fly off the handle at
any moment. And this feeling robs us of any sense
we might have that the singer has a message to give.</p>

<p>Most concert-goers know only too well how little
this principle is regarded among Lieder singers. Is
there one singer out of ten who does not try to transcend
his or her song? Is there one singer out of ten
who would not rather have his or her hearers at the
end of a piece exclaim: ‘A great singer!’ rather than
‘A great song!’ And to force their personalities to the
foreground singers will abuse their songs from beginning
to end. Often they do it intentionally, sincerely
believing that this is the only kind of singing that is
effective. But in a great number of cases, without
doubt, it is done unconsciously, as the natural and only
way of singing. A special coloring on one of the singer’s
pet tones, a long pause on a high note, an exaggerated
retard in a sentimental passage—these sins
against taste are being constantly committed by singers
whose only interest in songs is to advance their personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
reputations. In a way they are not to be blamed,
for competition is keen; a hundred fail where one succeeds,
and that one succeeds usually only by forcing
his personality on the public; and the public is inclined
to be <em>blasé</em>, to demand picturesque personalities, and
to grumble if a singer is ‘ordinary.’ Singers need intelligent
audiences as much as audiences need intelligent
singers.</p>

<p>But, whatever may be the lamentable state of actual
conditions, a song, if well sung, is sung with intelligent
restraint. The ideal singer will give a song as he believes
it should be given, without concession to the
prejudices of the audiences, content to let the work of
art speak for itself and to allow people to forget the
workman in their joy at the work.</p>

<p>And as soon as the demand for restraint is met, the
singer discovers a new and kindred demand in the song,
one which is quite as inherent in the art-type. This is the
demand for style. Style, as an artist uses it, is a ticklish
thing, one which cannot quite be put into words.
But every working artist feels it as a value. For, if
the singer is to pick and choose (as the composer
picked and chose previously) in the singing of a song,
he must do so according to some principle. This principle,
if it be genuine and not arbitrary, will be the
style of the song. It will make the hearer feel that the
interpretative details were not only chosen carefully,
but were chosen well. It is that subtle thing that seems
to make the song ‘hang together.’</p>

<p>Style, in short, is one more of the typical characteristics
of the good art-song. The style of a song is
unique. No two songs, thoroughly well sung, have exactly
the same style. The style is developed out of
the music itself; it is implied in the notes as they rest
on the printed page; it has awaited the discerning eye
of the interpretive artist. And so when a song has
been thoroughly understood and ‘lived in’ by the singer,
it will always have a personality or style of its own
which will hover above the song and embrace every
note. An art-song which on hearing does not reveal
a unique style is either a bad song or a good song badly
sung.</p>

<p>This type of art, the most delicate, the most personal,
the most self-contained, is laid in bewildering abundance
at our feet. And some fairly general acquaintance
with modern song literature is a necessity for the
singer or the concert-goer. A singer can no more understand
the songs she sings without at the same time
being familiar with others than a student can understand
the history of his own country without knowing
that of foreign lands. For such a singer to appear in
public as an interpreter is simply an insolence. If he
‘specializes’ in modern French songs, the more necessity
for him to know old German. You can never
appreciate any quality without knowing something of
its opposite. And the same rule applies to audiences.
The first song one hears in life probably goes unnoticed.
The second gives the attention something on
which to base a comparison. And every new acquisition
thereafter increases the opportunity for comparison—increases
the hearer’s pleasure. How much more
you have learned about Debussy when you have heard
a cycle of Moussorgsky!</p>

<p>And if a comparison is necessary between art-songs
of one and another lineage, how much more necessary
it is of art-songs and folk-songs. It is important for
singer and audience to know various types of art-songs.
It is much more important to know art-songs and folk-songs.
When he does, all that is peculiar to the art-song
becomes set off in relief, and all that is common
property becomes enhanced in value. A knowledge of
folk-songs is a knowledge of humanity in its simplest
terms. With it one can ‘walk with kings nor lose the
common touch.’</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The brothers Grimm, profound students of popular
lore, used to say that they had never found a single
lie in folk-poetry. This sounds strange as we think
of the giants and fairies who appear in it, along with
historical events given a completely new twist for the
sake of artistic attractiveness. Obviously the meaning
of the brothers Grimm was somewhat profound. And
so, too, is the truth in folk-poetry.</p>

<p>For the imagination of folk-poetry is not the promulgation
of lies, but the interpretation of facts. The folk-poets
meant something as they sang their songs, though
they may not have been entirely conscious about it.
Why, for instance, is there never a good stepmother in
folk-song? There have been good stepmothers, undoubtedly,
but the folk-poets knew that it is not in the nature
of things that stepmothers will be as good to children
as natural mothers. Or why does Jack the Giant Killer
not make a pact with the giant when he holds the
tyrant finally at his mercy, and live in luxury on a
part of the spoils ever afterward? It would be a realistic
ending. It would be true to modern politics and
correct according to the latest canons of art. But Jack
is a popular hero, and a popular hero does not betray
the people he fights for. If you want to know some
fact in the history of a people don’t go to the official<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
records; they may be tainted by the vanity of the
king or by the personal bias of the recorder. But go
to the people’s folk-lore. If the fact is there, it is a
truth as solid as the mountains. The song may tell
you that their good king had thirty-seven horses shot
under him in one day, that he fought and killed, single-handed,
ten men at arms who surrounded him. It
may tell you this, and you will perhaps suspect that
the arithmetic is faulty, but you will know that the
essential statement—that of the heroism and the popularity
of the king—is true. The king’s minstrel might
have made a song making a coward and tyrant a hero
and a popular leader; but he could not have made people
sing it. ‘The ballad-maker only wields his power
for as long as he is the true interpreter of the popular
will. Laws may be imposed on the unwilling, but not
songs.’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Written histories may tell you that under such
and such a king the people were happy—that the revolution
which came afterward was a factitious or fomented
one. Go to your folk-song. Bujor the Red-Headed, a
Moldavian brigand and a popular hero, was ‘pitiless
toward officers of government and toward nobles; he
was, on the contrary, most gracious toward peasants
and the unfortunate.’ This is historical evidence more
reliable than sealed parchment. The government of
that land was <em>not</em> good, the nobles were <em>not</em> beneficent.
No written history of a people can be considered reliable
as long as it conflicts with that people’s folk-lore.</p>

<p>Truthfulness to facts—this is what the brothers
Grimm claimed for folk-lore. Goethe ascribes to it
truthfulness to art. ‘The unsophisticated man,’ he
writes, ‘is more the master of direct, effective expression
in few words than he who has received a regular
literary education.’ The observation has been made
hundreds of times by competent judges. The simple
mind has a wonderful power of seeing the essential
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>in a thing and expressing it briefly and exactly. To
have command over expression in the simplest terms—is
this not the beginning of art?</p>

<p>This power which is revealed by folk-poetry is also
revealed by folk-music. The people’s melodies have
the same ‘direct, effective expression’ in a few notes
that Goethe noticed in their poetry. As truly as the
greatest composers, folk-songs can say universal things
in a few notes. Beethoven may have equalled, but he
never surpassed, the ‘direct, effective expression’ of
‘Auld Lang Syne.’ The majesty of this song can hardly
be equalled in the whole of musical literature. Many
people have noticed the peculiar effect of the refrain
which makes it seem as though a mighty and harmonious
orchestra of trumpets and trombones were joining
in the chorus. And this with a melody denuded of
every merely decorative tone, written in a scale of just
five notes!</p>

<p>Everywhere in folk-music we find this power of expressing
the highest things in the fewest notes. Only
the very greatest of conscious composers have been
able to compete with the folk-song on its own terms,
within its rigid limitations. Art-songs have elaborated
and refined. But it seems as though the <em>essence</em> is
always in the folk-tunes. Like the popular stories that
furnished plots to the old dramatists, these melodies
have supplied the simple musical resources which conscious
composers have developed. Every sort of emotion
is expressed in the folk-songs, every degree of
passion, every quality of mood—provided only it is human,
common to all men.</p>

<p>Do not think that folk-songs are an affair of the past,
a subject for the archeologist. One is inclined to think
that it is so among Anglo-Saxon people, especially in
America. But folk-songs are not only sung this moment
in many a land, but are yet living and growing in
more than one country. The quantity of very recent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Italian folk-songs is enormous. Every year, at the fair
of Piedegrotta, near Naples, the popular singers of the
city stand on a cart and sing the songs they have composed
in the past months. For hours these concerts
continue, the crowd moving from one singer to another.
The songs are caught up and sung by the listeners. At
the end of the festival no vote is taken, but everyone
knows which song has been the winner in the competition.
It is being sung from one end of the city to the
other. And the successful songs of the year’s festival
pass into folk-music of the people.</p>

<p>It is true of these songs (as was not true of earlier
folk-music) that the composers are known and remembered.
Indeed, the songs are promptly printed and
circulated. But the composers are nevertheless true
sons of the people. They have little knowledge of letters
and musical laws; they compose from the heart
and from the instinct for fitness. The music of such
composers can justly be classed as folk-music, since
it is utterly in the popular spirit and receives the <em>visé</em>
of the masses. It is more unfortunate that in Naples a
phonograph firm has undertaken to make commercial
capital out of the Fair of Piedegrotta, and every year
takes records of the successful songs, which it circulates
all over Europe. Under such conditions the composers
must necessarily soon lose the celebrated ‘folk
simplicity,’ if they have not lost it already.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that in Italy folk-music is still very
much alive. All that is new in life is celebrated by
these folk-poets. The famous ‘Funicula,’ a modern
Italian folk-song <em>par excellence</em>, was made to celebrate
the funicular or inclined railroad in the days when
this was a novelty. There is a well-known Neapolitan
song in honor of the telephone, and current events,
such as the Turkish war, receive generous attention.</p>

<p>In many other countries the <em>growth</em> of folk-song has
all but ceased, though the songs of former times are sung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
with almost as much zest as ever. But these songs (including
most of those familiar to us) are usually not of
great age. At least they have generally been remade in
more up-to-date form and do not plainly show evidences
of their age. Generally speaking, we may be sure
that any folk-song in the common major scale is to be
dated within the last two hundred years. It may have
been founded on an older song, but its modern changes
have been such as to give it a totally new flavor. This
is not to say that all old songs which remain living in
the hearts of the people become changed according to
musical fashions. Those which have a strong enough
traditional hold may keep their ancient form after Debussy
has been forgotten. Thus many an English folk-song,
startling and inspiriting in its originality, is in
a modal scale—with a minor that is not commonly
in use to-day, or else a shifting between one tonic and
another which carries us clearly back into the days
when tonality was not yet felt in scales. Yet these
songs were not committed to paper in Henry VIII’s or
Queen Elizabeth’s time, when they attained their present
form. They have mostly been discovered by earnest
searching only within the last ten years. They
lived, in unsophisticated, out-of-the-way places, in their
ancient form.</p>

<p>In general, of course, the question of the age or authenticity
of a folk-song is one for the musical archeologist,
rather than for the mere lover of music. The
folk-songs that are in the hands of the general public
are in all stages of authenticity and purity. There was
a time when no publisher who knew his business would
think of publishing a folk-song in its true form. It
was barbarous, not fit for the graces of the drawing-room.
So some composer of the fashion (or, failing
such, some hack) was hired to ‘arrange’ them and to
supply an accompaniment in approved style. And,
naturally, under such a régime it was not the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
characteristic of a country’s folk-songs that were
chosen, but those most similar to polite music—that
is, the least characteristic. Often the songs had been
transcribed by little-trained listeners or else not transcribed
at all, but only imperfectly remembered. There
was little of the national essence left in such music.
And the composers of the day discovered the fact and
turned it to their account. Why go to Sicily to pick
up folk-songs when Sicilian folk-songs can be written
without stirring out of your study in London? And
this is precisely what Sir Henry Bishop, for instance,
did. And it is to such a hoax that we owe the tune of
‘Home, Sweet Home,’ which was at first published in
a book of alleged Sicilian songs ‘edited’ by Bishop,
few, if any, of which were genuine.</p>

<p>These days, however, are past. The modern attitude
toward folk-songs is one of respect, almost of
reverence. The greatest of pains have been taken to
preserve the songs as they were actually sung, ‘mistakes’
and all. No tune of two notes is too slight to
be worth the trouble of accurate transcription. Especially
since the invention of the phonograph the scientific
study of folk-songs has prospered. Thousands
upon thousands of songs have been taken down by
the phonograph among the Indians of North America,
the negroes of Africa, and the Russians of the Caucasus.
The results, it is true, are likely to be regarded as
scientific—ethnological or psychological—data rather
than as artistic entities. But the tunes are accessible to
musicians and often appear in the art music of the
time—as we well know from Russian symphonies or
even from Charles Wakefield Cadman’s interesting
arrangements of Indian lyrics. And the value of the
accurate transcriptions as data for scientific æsthetic
theory cannot be overestimated.</p>

<p>However, most of the folk-songs available to the music
lover have not the stigma of ‘science’ attached to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
them. Nearly all that have been published in the last
ten years show some care of editing, some concern
that the tunes, if they be not exactly as they were in
their habitat, shall be true to the spirit of the original.
Some editions give the original unaccompanied form
of the tunes, perhaps with interesting variants. Few,
in fact, try to pull the wool over the reader’s eyes.
Scientific or not, modern editions of folk-songs show
a candor which the subject has long needed.</p>

<p>Many folk-songs, like the modern German, approximate
‘art’ music in their musical basis and can be
understood as they stand. That is, they have the prevailing
scales and are sung with accompaniments in
the accented harmony. But most folk-songs are not
sung with accompaniment. And when the editors begin
to supply accompaniments trouble ensues. For the
songs have their own style and will not coalesce with
a type of accompaniment made for another style. And
editors, trained in the schools, cannot produce a new
musical style at a moment’s notice. So the original
melodies may be changed and adapted more nearly to
a diatonic scale which will fit a ready-made accompaniment.
Or the accompaniment may do its best to
suit the modal or unusual style of the melodies. Or
both sides may be forced to make concessions. It
would be most satisfactory, if our ears could get used
to it, to sing these more unusual folk-songs without accompaniment
and not try the barbarous experiment of
making the right foot fit the left shoe. But even when
they are altered, these melodies retain much of their
beauty, and one would much rather have them ‘edited’
than not have them at all.</p>

<p>We must also mention that great class of songs
which are not strictly folk-songs at all, but deserve to
rank as folk-songs by every title except the technical
one. They are those songs written by conscious composers,
published and sold, but intended for wide circulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
and great popularity—those, in short, which
by their simplicity and genuineness evoke a human response
similar to that evoked by true folk-songs. Such
are the immortal songs of Stephen Foster in America—‘My
Old Kentucky Home,’ ‘Old Black Joe,’ and the rest.
Such is ‘Annie Laurie,’ one of the most beautiful of
melodies. And such are the German songs of Silcher—<em>Die
Lorelei</em>, <em>Scheiden</em>, and many others. Nearly
all these composers have been without aptitude in
the larger musical forms—often persons of little education
and culture. Very few great composers have succeeded
in thus writing folk-songs. Weber, of all of
them, is the nearest to the folk-spirit, and the slow
movement of Agathe’s aria, <em>Leise, leise</em>, from <em>Der
Freischütz</em>, is now a permanent folk-song with the best
of them. Schubert’s <em>Lindenbaum</em> and <em>Heidenröslein</em>
have the same quality. Mendelssohn is a folk-composer
by virtue of his song <em>Es ist bestimmt</em> in <em>Gottes Rath</em>.
But in general it has seemed next to impossible for a
conscious and highly trained composer to catch the
spirit of the folk in simplest terms.</p>

<p>The most available folk-music for the average student
is that which is freely arranged and edited by a
man whose name is a guarantee of honest and musicianly
work—such a man as Weckerlin, collector and
editor of French songs from the earliest to the most
recent; or Cecil Sharp, collector of forgotten songs in
Somersetshire, England. Such an editor may keep the
songs intact or may vary them, may adopt some one
else’s accompaniment or write one of his own, but he
will always do it intelligently, altering only what it is
reasonably necessary to alter, and keeping always true
to the spirit, if not to the letter, of the original.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that the songs to be described
in the following pages are, many of them, sung
quite spontaneously and naturally to-day by the peasants
and unsophisticated people of the various countries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
The writer, while crossing the ocean, once listened
for hours to the Dutch steerage passengers amusing
themselves with songs and dances. And he recognized
among the songs the famous ‘William of Nassau,’
probably centuries old. Thus simple people in
European countries are constantly singing enduring
masterpieces of music along with much, of course, that
is ephemeral.</p>

<p>In the very brief survey which we shall make of folk-songs
as the student finds them to his hand to-day we
shall be able to do no more than suggest the national
characteristics of each group. Anything like a list of
the fine songs of each nation, or an adequate appreciation
of its popular music, would be impossible in less
than a volume. Likewise, all the interesting questions
of racial characteristics as affecting art, of technical
development and international interchange, of æsthetic
theory and melodic analysis, must be left quite to one
side until there shall be written the adequate book on
folk-music which as yet does not exist in the English
language. The present chapter attempts only to suggest
the contrasting characteristics of the different folk-song
traditions and the amazing extent of the treasure
which has until so recently remained for the most part
unknown, or known only to be snubbed.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>England, Scotland, and Ireland, now grouped together
as the tiniest part only, geographically speaking,
of the British Empire, were in early times as distinct
and as antagonistic, nationally, as Germany and France
are to-day. The lack of means of communication and
social organization made it possible for very different
social and artistic traditions to flourish independently
within a few miles of each other. Thus there grew up
in these countries highly distinct musical traditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
which have preserved their individuality even through
these days of printing presses and phonographs. Each
of these musical traditions—the English, the Scotch,
and the Irish—had its roots in the earliest times of
which we have any record. And it is evident that the
musical life of these countries was vigorous in the extreme.
The beauty and individuality of the Scotch
and Irish songs are familiar, but it has been accepted
as axiomatic until recently that England was an unmusical
nation—that she had neither the geniuses to create
nor the people to appreciate the finest and sincerest
musical beauty. Especially it was supposed that she
had no truly creative folk-song. Certainly it is true
that England for centuries stifled her folk-song, keeping
it among the peasant classes, dumb and suppressed,
where Germany coaxed hers upward to illumine and
inspire the whole nation to great deeds. Recent investigators,
notably Mr. Cecil Sharp, have unearthed in
Somersetshire and elsewhere a great wealth of popular
songs, most of them never before set on paper, but
many of them showing great antiquity and distinctive
beauty. This folk-art existed for centuries among the
almost unlettered classes without the nation as a whole
being aware of the fact. Now that the songs have been
noted down and published it can never again be said
that England, in the roots of her, is unmusical or uncreative
in popular song. These songs, which are all
the more charming for never having felt the influence
of learned music, are almost as peculiar and inimitable
as those of Scotland or Russia. Those of ancient origin—roughly
speaking, from Elizabeth’s time or previous—are
modal in style. But the modes are not the
usual ones of the melodic minor or its most familiar
variation, the Doric. They are the queerest things imaginable
to modern ears, strange scales with raised
sixths and lowered sevenths, melting from minor into
major and back again. The feeling for the tonic is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
often very vague, the chief note of the scale being
sometimes the second or the fourth or the fifth. These
unquestionable evidences of antiquity lend a strange
charm to the melodies. And the charm is one that is
distinct from that of every other national folk-music.</p>

<p>The earliest of the English songs, barring a few questionable
specimens, probably date from the time of
Henry VIII (1491-1547), who was himself an accomplished
musician and composer of several excellent
songs. Among these are the Boar’s Head Carol, antedating
1521, still sung at Christmas gatherings; and the
traditional tune for Shakespeare’s lyric, ‘Oh, Mistress
Mine.’ Some of the simple airs to which the old Robin
Hood ballads were sung also date from this period.
The traditional air for the Chevy Chase ballads dates
from the time of Charles I. But from this time on
what passed in England for folk-songs were usually
nothing but popular songs of the moment, published
like any others and sung widely among the middle
classes. These songs will be treated in another chapter.
For our purpose here we must now skip more
than three centuries and come down to the time when
the interest in folk-song and folk-dancing began to revive
in England. For the recent crop of folk-songs we
are indebted to the labors of investigators like Mr.
Sharp, patient, painstaking, sympathetic, and admirably
equipped in point of musical technique. These
men combine the qualities of the artist and the scientist.
They have passed quite beyond the attitude of
the eighteenth century collectors of folk-poetry—such
distinguished men as Bishop Percy and Sir Walter
Scott—who did their work out of personal enthusiasm
but felt obliged to apologize for the poems they found.
(Herder, who worked in Germany about the same time,
was the one man who took the modern attitude, which
is equally scholarly, scientific, and artistic.) The modern
investigators feel their obligations to preserve the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
songs exactly as they come from the lips of the people.
When they publish collections of these songs for
popular use they supply accompaniments which are
sometimes sophisticated and, in Mr. Sharp’s case, scholarly
and delightful. But they seek always to preserve
the letter and the spirit of the melodies in their arrangements.
Such singers as the Misses Fuller, and
Yvette Gilbert and her pupil Miss Loraine Wyman have
spread the knowledge of the folk-songs of England and
France and have demonstrated the great beauty of
them to thousands who had never suspected it.</p>

<p>The English songs, fine as they are from a technical
standpoint, have no very great emotional range. A
few, like the famous ‘Willow’ song, strike a deep note
of sorrow, but by far the greater portion are lively songs
of the open-air or of festal gatherings. They reveal
a vigorous sense of touch, a whole-hearted joy in the
primitive feelings of the human body, in the invigorating
English out-of-doors. They are clear-cut and literal—recalling
the type of life and feeling which we associate
with ‘the roast beef of old England.’ Their naïveté
is that of an exuberant joy in the commonplace joys
of life. We may mention such songs as ‘The Wraggle
Taggle Gipsies, O!’ and ‘The Holly and the Ivy’ for their
inspiriting physical vigor. Such songs as ‘God Rest
Ye Merry Gentlemen’ (old tune), the Wassail song
from Sussex, or the Sheep-shearing Song from Somerset,
are worthy of much study as fine examples of the
old English use of modal scales.</p>

<p>The Scotch songs, of all true folk-songs the world
over, have for many decades been the most familiar.
No nation, except perhaps Russia, has been more vigorously
creative in its folk-music than Scotland. Many
excellent judges regard the Scotch folk-music as the
finest in the world. It is probably quite as ancient as
any. It entered into the lives of the Scotch people
from the earliest times, when the Highland bards sang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
their praises to little tribal chieftains or narrated in
rude verse the battles between one clan and another.
There is a very old harper’s tune in existence, probably
much modified in the course of the centuries but still
eloquent of antiquity, which suggests the majesty of
the days gone by. (It may be found under its modern
title, ‘Harp of the Highlands.’) A large proportion of
these tunes have lost their original words and taken
on new ones. Robert Burns stimulated the process by
writing words of his own (among them some of the
greatest of his poems) for well-known melodies. The
loss of the old texts, which were often crude or indecent,
is, on the whole, of little moment from the artistic
standpoint, especially since Burns, one of the finest
folk-spirits of all ages, wrote words which fit the
mouths of the people like their own. Perhaps, too, his
words, as in the case of ‘Scots Wha Hae,’ helped to
keep the old tunes alive and popular. Burns is one
of the rare instances of a conscious artist who has been
able to meddle with folk-art without making himself
ridiculous.</p>

<p>A large number of the Scotch songs are written in the
pentatonic or five-note scale—our ordinary major with
the fourth and seventh omitted. Whether this was due
to some early form of the Scotch bagpipe or to the
genius of the people is still an open question.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But it
is certain that the Scotch have given an individual
flavor to their songs by means of this scale without
betraying the least embarrassment over the absence
of the two notes. Who imagines, for instance, until it
is pointed out, that the magnificent ‘Auld Lang Syne’
is wholly in the pentatonic? The pentatonic feeling
runs through nearly all the Scotch songs and in a
large proportion of them exists almost in full purity.
The occasional use of the fourth and seventh in the
tunes of ‘Scots Wha Hae’ or ‘The Campbells Are Coming’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
is unessential and probably a recent modification.</p>

<p>The range of feeling in the Scotch songs is almost
equal to that of music itself. ‘Scots Wha Hae’ ranks
with the three or four finest patriotic songs the world
over. No grander hymn than ‘Auld Lang Syne’ has
ever been sung; even <em>Adeste Fideles</em>, that treasure of
the modern hymnal, seems to take on a certain triviality
beside its irresistible rhythm. And what dance tune
can be found that contains such an inexhaustible supply
of life as ‘The Campbells Are Coming’ or ‘A Highland
Lad My Love Was Born?’ Where can one match
the pensive sadness of ‘Loch Lomond’ or the sentimental
tenderness of ‘Will Ye Gang Over the Lee?’
Some of the Jacobite songs—‘Charlie Is My Darling’ or
‘The Piper of Dundee’—are inimitable for high spirits.
One who turns over the pages of a book of Scotch
folk-songs will find melodies of deep emotion unsurpassed
in all song literature. Scotch song has also
been materially enriched by conscious composers,
though never, perhaps, by eminent ones. We need only
mention the impressive ‘Caller Herrin’,’ or ‘Annie
Laurie,’ one of the greatest folk-songs of all times. A
thorough knowledge of Scotch folk-songs will acquaint
the singer with almost every fundamental type of lyric
utterance.</p>

<p>The Irish folk-song, likewise, is very fine, but it has,
on the whole, neither the flexible range nor the supreme
sense of artistic fitness possessed by the Scotch. The
dominant moods are two: one the lively dance spirit,
represented by the Irish jigs and reels; and the other
the richly sentimental and even tragic tone of the love
songs. As it happens, Irish folk-song has undergone
the same process as the Scotch in having a native poet
supply in great abundance new words to the old tunes.
The ‘Irish Melodies’ of Sir Thomas Moore are pretentious
poems designed to supplant the homely words of
the folk-poets. But if Burns escaped being ridiculous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
in his attempt to supply his native country with a new
folk-art, Moore emphatically did not. Nothing could
be more incongruous than his pompous poems with
their dreary romantic paraphernalia of harps and fair
ladies. As poems his lyrics have only the virtues of
the drawing-room, a mellifluous flow of words and a
certain sensuous grace. As folk-art they are a painful
absurdity. They evoke abstractions and conventional
poetic phrases where the popular genius goes unerringly
to concrete fact. They have the dreary sameness
of the second-rate talent where the folk-poetry has all
the variety of the commonplace things of this world
and of the ordinary people in it. Yet Moore’s words
are in many instances firmly wedded to the music in
the popular mind, and it is not likely that a divorce will
ever be achieved. This is doubtless because, false as
the poet was to the spirit of the music, he caught and
persuasively stated the romantic sentimentality of the
Celtic nature.</p>

<p>Some of the older Irish songs have an archaic flavor
not less marked than the English. The Doric mode
especially is used sometimes with savage vigor. Indeed,
the Irish as the race of warriors are represented
almost exclusively in the older songs—songs like ‘Remember
the Glories of Brian the Brave’ or ‘The Sword
Shining Brightly’ (Moore’s words), which in their crude
martial frenzy can hardly be matched the world over.
The innumerable jigs and reels, some of which are of
the finest quality, are often close to the Scotch in physical
energy, but in nearly every case they preserve a
certain note of sadness. Perhaps the best of all the
Irish songs are the sentimental ones. The fine tunes
to which Moore set his words ‘The Harp that Once
Through Tara’s Halls’ and ‘When in Death’ strike a
wonderfully deep chord of emotion. It is hard to realize
the great number of sentimental Irish tunes which
are of the highest beauty. They suffer, however, too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
often from excess. The long drawn cadences are hard
to render honestly; in their excess of feeling they are
apt to sound insincere. They lack the clear-cut statement
which makes the Scotch songs so unfailingly
true to the highest demands of art. Yet the folk-song
of Ireland is a product of which any nation might be
proud. And, on the whole, the folk-music of the British
Isles is their worthiest contribution to musical literature.
In former ages these islands were not inferior
to any country in Europe in musical vigor. As the
centuries have passed and left England far behind in
musical creation these songs have remained as a proof
of the sound healthfulness and the exuberant creativeness
of her popular genius.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The French folk-song more than any other has contained
from early times the spirit of its conscious art.
Or perhaps France’s conscious art has, more than in
most countries, been true to the genius of its people
as revealed in its folk-art. Its melodies are rarely rich
and luscious—rarely even emotional in the more strenuous
sense of the term. Often they seem, at first hearing,
to be cold and thin. But such a view is, of course,
false. The French melodies have both emotion and
sensuous beauty. But it is in the famous French
‘taste’ not to shout one’s message to the heavens. You
do not appreciate the meaning of these melodies until
you have come to know and love them, just as you do
not appreciate the meaning of a child until you have
come to know and love him. You must be on the alert,
sensitive to catch the meaning of a whisper or a gesture.
And, in addition to the meaning, you must learn
to love the formal beauty of a French melody. No nation
has carried perfection of form, even in the smallest
things, to such a pitch as the French. The opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
phrase of a French folk-tune may seem almost meaningless
and pointless. But somewhere in it there is a
suggestion of something distinctive in it. Watch for
this, then follow it out in the other phrases—a gentle
contrast, a delicate indiscretion, a comforting restatement.
In some moods we shall find this whispered
statement more stimulating, more thrilling than any
burst of Italian passion.</p>

<p>As early as the fifteenth century we have French
songs which show these qualities of restraint and delicate
design. Of such we may instance <em>Sy je perdoys
mon amy</em> and <em>Vray Dieu d’amours</em>. As we come to
later centuries we find a host of songs (collected in
great numbers by Weckerlin) which are scarcely to
be distinguished from the simple songs of the great
French composers. The delightful <em>chanson</em>, <em>O, ma tendre
Musette</em>, is accredited to Monsigny, but it is an
open question whether the melody was not taken by
him bodily from a folk-tune. Many are the <em>villanelles</em>
and <em>musettes</em> which are of folk origin. In no other
country are the folk-music and the art-music less distinct.
A few French songs, like <em>Le pauvre laboureur</em>,
show the freedom and irregularity of phrase which betoken
a development independent of art-music. This
particular song is almost unrhythmical, probably a development
from one or two stereotyped phrases, like
the street-cries of Paris and of some of the Italian
cities. But irregular songs are unusual. The French
popular genius seems to have the same sense for design
that has made the great men of France distinguished,
and this sense is shown almost universally in
its songs. (See Appendix for French-Canadian Folk-song.)</p>

<p>There could hardly be a more violent contrast than
between the folk-music of the two Latin countries,
France and Italy. The Italians are famous for their
violent emotions, and these are revealed in their folk-songs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
puffing like a steam engine. The utmost of passionate
expression, by any means at hand—this seems
to be the ideal of a goodly portion of the songs. Where
the French songs are reserved the Italian are frenzied;
where the French are delicate the Italian are like a
sledge-hammer; where the French use a needle the Italian
use an ax. This statement must be made with some
exceptions, notably the songs of Venice and certain
other northern localities. The Venetian songs are reserved
and chiselled. Many of them might have been
written by Mozart. They never go to excess of emotion.
They are often as formally perfect as the French.
The song known as ‘The Fisher’ (which has practically
become a folk-song in Germany) may be taken as a
fair example of this graceful and discreet type of lyric.
As we go farther south the heat and sensuousness of
the land show more and more in the music: Naples
has a type of folk-song all her own. It sometimes
shows the grace of the Venetian song, but never its
reserve. The lighter songs all have an ardor of their
own, for the Southern Italian is never abstract. But
their lightness carries with it a certain fickleness, as
though the lover expected to serenade at least a dozen
fair ladies before the night was done. <em>La Vera Sorrentina</em>
is one of the best of this type. The Neapolitan
are perhaps the best known of all the Italian songs,
and there are thousands of them that have been published.
A large proportion of these are not strictly
folk-songs, having been written by conscious composers
(who, however, were of the people and composed
for the people). For it seems that the folk-genius of
the Italians was almost dormant in music for several
centuries. But these semi-folk-songs are among the
best. The more modern ones nearly always betray a
certain vulgarity, a certain commonplaceness somewhere
in their outline—a fault which is not often to be
charged against the genuine folk-song. But one is willing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
to forgive them this, for the sake of the loveliness
which is beneath it all. The strains of <em>Oh, sole mio</em>
have already gone round the world, and <em>Oh, Maria</em> is
scarcely inferior. And when the Italian Song (especially
the Sicilian) breaks out in full passion it is
not to be matched for crude emotional power the world
over. Any one of these songs, as, for instance, the fine
one known from its refrain as <em>O, Mama mia</em>, shows
the inspiration of the bloody Italian operas of the ’nineties.</p>

<p>Much of the Italian folk-music is enlivened with the
most powerful rhythm imaginable. The dance is cultivated
in Italy as it is in scarcely any other country
in the world. Many of the Spanish rhythms are to be
found in the Italian songs, a relic of the times when the
Spaniards held Sicily and the southern parts of the
peninsula. We should not forget, either, the inimitable
joke-songs of the Italians, the clear source of the <em>opera
buffa</em>, which has been cultivated successfully by no
other people. The love of the Italians for a joke has
been noted from the earliest mediæval times. We need
only listen to the Italian fruit-merchant trying to convince
the ward politician that Columbus discovered
Ireland to know that the <em>tempo allegro giocoso</em> is as
alive to-day in the southern Latins as it ever was.
The innumerable joke songs of Italy present a peculiar
problem to the singer. They must be sung with the
most expert enunciation, with a fine technique that
conceals all art, and with a spirit bursting with fun.
Perhaps it would be truer to say that they are impossible
to any but the Italian born and bred. Their purely
musical value, it must be admitted, is usually slight;
but they have none the less a high place in folk-song
literature. It is only fair to say that the musicianship
of the Italian songs is often careless and faulty. Especially
is this likely to be true in the accompaniments,
which are always of the simplest possible description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
and frequently become monotonous with their limited
supply of chords in regular succession. Yet this fault is
only one more mark of the Italian genius, to which the
melody—that is, the voice part, the human part—is
all-important.</p>

<p>The Spanish songs are much less known than they
deserve. Of Spain, as of England, it can be said that
its folk-songs are its chief musical contribution. The
pure folk-song of Spain, given to the world chiefly
through the researches of the composer Albéniz, is
highly sectional and local, primitive, almost untouched
by the traditions of the great world of music. Just
across this low range of mountains there may be another
quite different type of song, with different scales
and different rhythms and a different type of emotional
utterance corresponding to the sectional variation of
temperament. In addition to this pure folk-song
there is an extensive Spanish folk-music which is somewhat
more sophisticated and much better known. It
is this class that chiefly contains the wonderful dance-tunes
which we associate with Spain—for here rhythm
is cultivated as nowhere else in the world. The chief
rhythms—those of the <em>Habañera</em>, the <em>Seguidilla</em>, the <em>Bolero</em>,
the <em>Fandango</em>, and the rest—have in the Spanish
songs a poignancy which it is impossible to analyze.
The melodies seem built on and for the rhythms. Both
may seem simple and literal, yet there is a peculiar
fitness in this simplicity which is ever the mark of the
folk-genius, and which in this case gives the rhythms an
unbelievable quantity of physical drive. The chief
geographical and political sections of Spain have preserved
their individuality in their folk-songs. The Castilian
song is light and sparkling. The Catalonian is
sombre and intense. The Andalusian is sensuous and
passionate. In the singing of all these songs there is
scarcely a trace of the intellectual factor. They are to
be sung in a sort of divine frenzy. It is not too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
to say that they must be sung with the whole physical
body. For their powerful rhythm must be felt in every
nerve and muscle, else it cannot be expressed in the
voice. Of all songs these of Spain demand the most
of the merely physical—of bone and nerves and muscles.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The German folk-songs, because they are the best
known of all, will here be treated briefly. They have,
as we shall so often have occasion to point out, that
faculty of concentrating intense and elevated emotion
in a simple phrase of a few notes. The great progressions
that ring in Bach, the great cadences which thunder
forth in the Lutheran chorale—these we feel in all
German popular song. The number of these songs is
as the sands of the sea. The emotional range is almost
that of the human heart itself. The melodic organization
is much more complex than in the case of the
Italian songs. Sometimes it becomes even austere.
But, on the whole, no nation has songs which go so
straight to the heart. They are not remarkable for
rhythm nor in general for the lighter qualities prized
by the French and the north Italians. Their character
is, rather, homely and intimate. Some of them reflect
the vigorous and rather rough spirits of German youth.
More reflect the exaggerated sentimentality of German
middle age. Yet this sentimentality, while it is introspective,
is never morbid. It is founded deep in the
heart of a magnificently healthy people and is no more
than the honest expression of a passing mood. From
the time of the Minnesingers and their charmingly
graceful ditties the idealism of the German people has
been revealed in their singing. Frequently this takes
on a religious tinge, so that the Lutheran church could
adopt true folk-tunes for its hymns without incongruity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Often the spirit of quite secular songs is essentially
religious, as in that magnificent song of Silcher’s—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>‘Aennchen von Tharau, mein Reichthum, mein Gut,<br>
Du bist mein Leben, mein Fleisch und mein Blut.’</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Certainly these songs of Germany can, of all folk-songs,
least bear any insincerity or affectation. They seem to
be a touchstone for determining genuineness of soul—that
quality which the Germans call <em>Echtheit</em>. They,
above all other songs, demand soundness of musicianship
and honesty of method.</p>

<p>Unwillingly leaving these songs with these few remarks,
we turn to the Scandinavian countries, which
are closely allied to Germany in their folk-music, yet
show a definite though subtle individuality. The Danish
songs retain the sincerity of the German, but add,
perhaps, a little more lightness of touch, a little more
feeling for delicacy of design. Their relation with the
songs of the northern Scandinavian countries is tenuous
but it can be noticed after a little study. The
songs of Sweden are much more individual, though
they can hardly be said to surpass the German in any
particular. Most popular among them are the famous
‘Neck Polka,’ the spirited ‘Marching Song,’ and the old
ballad, ‘Little Karen,’ the last a melody wonderful in
its combination of literal musical statement with subtle
artistic grace. Norway, most distant of the three countries,
has quite naturally shown itself most individual
in its folk-music. It is the individuality which many
critics have found in the music of Grieg. It bears an
air of mystery; one hardly knows whether of the past
or of the future. It suggests at times the downrightness
of the old Vikings, and at others the ‘atmospheric’
quality of the modern composers. However one may
feel about this, it is certain that the spirit is healthy
and stimulating. For variety and interest the folk-music
of Norway can rank among the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The folk-music of the Hungarians has been made
universally popular through the Hungarian Rhapsodies
of Liszt, who was one of the first to perceive its
high artistic possibilities. It has been generally supposed
that this folk-music was invented by the Gypsies,
who have always been regarded as the Hungarian musicians
<em>par excellence</em>. Liszt regarded it so. Competent
investigators agree that the melodies themselves
are the product of the Hungarian people and that
the ornaments and stylistic qualities alone have
been added by the Gypsies, who, according to this view,
are incapable of true invention. It is at least certain
that the Gypsies are the representative musicians of
Hungary to-day and have wholly stamped Hungarian
folk-music with their individuality. It has been said
that Hungary has no vocal folk-music—no folk-<em>song</em> at
all. This, of course, is true only in a limited sense.
But it is certainly true that all the music has a predominantly
instrumental character and that the greater
portion of it is possible only on instruments. The
Gypsies themselves, though usually without formal
musical education, are frequently marvellous masters
of the violin in their own way. Their love for long and
meaningless decoration is famous. No tune enters their
keeping that does not emerge covered from beginning
to end with trills, shakes, slides, turns, scales, and
cadenzas. The <em>rubato</em> instinct among them is very
strong. At the same time the rhythmical and dance
instinct is almost unsurpassed. And, as anyone familiar
with the Rhapsodies well knows, these three
qualities—namely the instrumental, the decorative and
the rhythmic—have stamped themselves indelibly on
all Hungarian folk-music. The Gypsies tend to mutilate
a tune past recognition by their wanton decoration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
But when they are able to keep their instinct
in control they leave the melody glittering with decorative
richness but firm and vigorous in outline.</p>

<p>The chief external characteristic of the Hungarian
melodies,—their accented grace-note (a feature scarcely
to be found in any other folk-music the world over,
except to a smaller degree in the Scotch)—is said to
come from the character of the Hungarian language,
which is inclined to heavily accented first syllables.
A more probable explanation would be that it comes
from the nature of the violin, on which most of these
melodies were doubtless composed. For in the case of
a short grace-note, the violinist’s bow has hardly time
to take a new stroke between the grace-note and the
chief note; hence both are taken on one stroke, and as
the beginning of the stroke is the natural place for
the accent the grace-note, however short, tends to take
on all the accent of a true first note of the rhythmic
measure. Yet such abstract discussion is empty in the
face of the melodies themselves. Many of these are
songs and excellent ones—whether composed for the
words originally or fitted out with words later makes
little difference. And many of them are distinctly singable,
though they demand a robust vocal mechanism
such as few parlor-trained singers possess. But
whether sung or not they are all glorified dances. The
<em>rubato</em> may be elaborate, but the feeling of rhythm
is always present. Many of the songs preserve the
form of the national dance, the Czardas, beginning
with a slow Lassan and ending with the violent Friska,
as in the Hungarian Rhapsodies. There may be pauses
and cadenzas between the two, there may be pauses
and long <em>ritardandos</em> in the body of the dance itself
(as frequently in the well-known Brahms arrangements
of Hungarian dances), but the firm rhythmic sense is
always there.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Hungarian melodies, merely as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
melodies, is unsurpassed. The great melody which
Liszt used in the Fourteenth Hungarian Rhapsody, and
which has since come to be used as the national song,
to the fine words which in the German version commence
<em>Wenn dem Ungarvolke Gott viel Leiden gab</em>—this
has become a true folk-song by adoption, though
it is not one in origin. No country ever had a more
glorious hymn for its national praise. Several dance-tunes
given by Reimann<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> are of the highest quality—especially
<em>Zigeunermusik</em>, <em>Der Seele Spiegel</em>, and <em>Drunten
im Tale</em>, and <em>Erwartung</em>, the last being a melody
which served Brahms for one of his ‘Hungarian
Dances.’ Another matchless tune is one translated by
Reimann as <em>In Grosswardein</em>. Here we see used to full
value (in a melody of great simplicity) several of
the most distinctive qualities of the Hungarian music,
namely the accented grace note, the peculiar minor
scale having a flatted sixth and a raised seventh, and
always emphasizing the skip between, and the conventional
phrase structure, which always repeats the
first phrase, note for note, in the dominant. Indeed,
no songs are better worth study for their clear and
solid architecture. Francis Alexander Korbay (born,
Pesth, 1848; died, 1914) was one of the chief enthusiasts
for the Hungarian folk-song and has helped by
his collections and editions to spread the love of them.
His arrangements are sometimes elaborate and often
not true to the spirit of the original, but they sufficiently
preserve the national spirit to foreign ears.
And it has always been true that folk-music must
first go through a stage of adaptation and arrangement
before people are willing to listen to it in its purity.
Of the Korbay songs at least one fine example, ‘Had
a Horse,’ has become familiar in American concert
halls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The Russian folk-songs, as rich in variety and intensity
as those of any country on earth, present more
preliminary difficulties to the foreign music-lover
than any others. As in most other countries, the real
appreciation of folk-music in Russia is a matter of the
last half century. The Russian songs which were best
known before then bore the same relation to the genuine
article that the popular English songs of the eighteenth
century bore to the Somerset songs of which we
have spoken—that is, they were rather civilized, perhaps
consciously composed, and contained far more of
the conventional than of the national. Such a song is
‘The Red Sarafan,’ a fine melody, but far removed
from the genuine peasant folk-song. Glinka, founder
of the modern Russian school of composition, recognized
the distinctive qualities of the Russian popular
music, and introduced some of its effects very tentatively
into his operas and songs. Rubinstein hazarded
the statement that the Russian folk-song was more
varied and profound than that of any other land. But
Rubinstein, being all German in his training, did not
follow the obvious moral. It remained for the great
group of ‘neo-Russian’ composers, under the inspiring
leadership of Balakireff, to make the Russian folk-song
the source and standard of Russian composition. Several
of this group made researches among folk-songs
or collections of them and studied them in what we
have called the modern spirit, which is equally scientific,
scholarly, and artistic. More recently the Russian
government has spent considerable sums on scientific
investigation among the peasants, and the results of
these researches, especially in the great work of Mme.
Lineva, have served as a standard in folk-research the
world over. The earlier collections of Balakireff, Rimsky-Korsakoff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and others, though as yet untranslated,
are sources of deep delight for the student who will
take a little trouble among dusty libraries.</p>

<p>The great body of Russian folk-songs is far nearer to
the primitive than is the popular music of Italy, Scotland,
and Germany. Many of the loveliest tunes are
mere snatches of melody. The more highly organized
tunes are frequently irregular and crude. The scales
are usually distinctive, and the tonic is inclined to be
very movable, if not entirely absent. The minor, of
course, predominates, as in all primitive music. It
is used with the utmost distinction, showing how utterly
Russian life (except in the highest classes) has
for centuries been isolated from the influence of Western
Europe. The common impression, because of the
predominance of this minor, is that Russian songs are
all ‘sad’ or ‘moody.’ This is not just, for the minor,
which is an expressive means with us, is nothing more
than a convention in Russian folk-music. It is the
material out of which the music is made. It can be
manipulated to express almost any emotion which the
singer can feel. Hence the notion that the range of
Russian folk-songs is narrow is quite false. They have
a remarkably wide range, from the deepest gloom,
through the tenderest sentimentality, to the fiercest exhilaration
of physical life. The irregularity of the
melodies, too, is not necessarily a sign of crudeness,
but often an instrument of the highest expressive potency.</p>

<p>The brief studies which will be made later in this
volume into Russian art-song can have but little meaning,
except in relation to the folk-songs which are the
source of it. The irregularity of metre in Moussorgsky’s
songs, the barbarity of some of Borodine’s and
Rachmaninoff’s, are the direct outcome of these composers’
studies in folk-song. It is difficult to mention
these songs by name, since few of the texts have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
translated into English. Yet it would be a pity if the
student were altogether debarred from a knowledge of
this wonderful literature on that account. The standard
collections of Russian folk-music are available,
though somewhat difficult to obtain. And though the
words are printed in fearsome Russian, the music is in
an international language. And it is of course true
that many of the Russian songs are to be found in
general folk-song collections and may be discovered
with a little searching. Those who read French will
find in Mme. Lineva’s work, published in two languages
by the Russian government, an admirable discourse
on Slavic song, thoroughly scientific, yet clear
and without great technicality. In this work the interested
musical student will find one of the most fascinating
subjects imaginable—the growth of independent
polyphony and counterpoint spontaneously
among the singers of the melodies, a thing unthinkable
to those of us who have learned counterpoint
from dry text books.</p>

<p>Bohemia and Poland, though Slavic in blood, are
widely separated from Russia in their art. The latter
has for many centuries been Roman Catholic in religion,
and had attained a high degree of Western culture
and refinement when Muscovy was still semi-barbarian.
In fact the political rivalry between the eastern
and western Slavs, intensified by the difference in
religion, led the Poles to look to the west for their
friends and their cultural models. Bohemia, too, as
early as the thirteenth century, was peculiarly western
in its ideals. It possessed the earliest real university,
and nurtured the non-secular attitude toward learning
which later came to such glorious fruit in France and
Germany. Further, the Bohemians were the earliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Protestants and free-thinkers, and showed the most enlightened
political aspirations in an age of darkness.
So, in spite of blood and language, these two nations
show in their art a dominant kinship with Germany.</p>

<p>One of the earliest Bohemian folk-songs, <em>Sirotek</em>
(‘The Waif’), might almost be taken for a German
chorale of the sixteenth century. Other popular songs,
like <em>Wsak nam tak</em> (‘The Sweetheart’) and <em>Dobromyslua
husicka</em> (‘The Happy Gosling’), are almost Tyrolese
in their mellifluous facility. Still another fine song,
<em>Na tech Kolodejskejch</em> (‘Vain Regrets’), might in parts
be a German children’s song. Again the song, <em>Pod tim
nasim okeneckem</em> (‘Under Our Cottage Window’), with
its ‘snaps’ and sharp accents, suggest the melodies of
Hungary. Thus Bohemia, in her folk-music, shows the
influence of her neighbors on all sides, but scarcely a
trace of the indigenous Slavic stock. Many of the songs
show a high degree of formal perfection, and the sentiment,
especially in the tenderer moods, is often deep
and moving. Such a lyric as the lullaby, <em>Hajej muj
andilku</em>, may rank with the best of any land in sheer
beauty. If we look among the Bohemian songs for
the nationalism that reveals itself in strange scales and
irregular rhythm we shall find scarcely a trace of it.
The metre and melodic line are always mature and
polished. But with our inner ear we may detect, in
the best songs, an endearing quality, a sweet lovableness,
which speaks with a distinct and national voice.</p>

<p>The qualities of Polish national music have been
made known most widely in the mazurkas of Chopin.
These must not be taken as representing the real qualities
of the Polish folk-song, but they offer an excellent
point of departure. In some ways the songs of Poland
show a racial relation with the Russian. The swift-moving
energy, the recurring and pervading melancholy,
find their parallels in the music of the eastern
Slavs. But the scale is nearly always the familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
major, or a slightly modified minor. The western nations
outgrew the uncertain tonality of the old modes
much earlier than the east, and Poland, with her eyes
always toward the west, doubtless adopted the technique
of music as she found it. Thus such a song as
the <em>Krakowiak</em> (an irresistible dance movement),
though it recalls in some vague way the spirit of Little
Russian music, lends itself perfectly to conventional
German harmonization. Another song, <em>Gdy wczystem
polu</em> (‘In Summer’), might have been thrown off in
one of Chopin’s idle moments. What these songs have,
above all other qualities, is grace. No nation, in its
folk-music, has used rhythm with greater delicacy.
They recall to us a Poland of the story-books, a land of
dilettantism and social graces. More than any other
folk-songs, except the French, they demand in their
interpretation a subtle ear and a firm artistic control.</p>

<p>The United States of America has its own folk-music
of a sort, a part of it quite indigenous. This part is
the music of the North American Indians, which is
more primitive than any other large body of folk-music
in our possession. There are, also, the songs of the
western cowboys, the ‘Spirituals’ and slave-songs of the
southern negroes, and the songs of Stephen Foster, all
of which are worthy to rank as folk-songs. All these
examples of American music have been exhaustively
treated in Volume IV (Chapter XI).</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>We think of the first eight or ten centuries of the
Christian era as a chasm between the ancient and the
modern. But this is of course not strictly true, least
of all in folk-music. In the church, indeed, music
struggled slowly and painfully, surrounded by doctrine
and law. But in the music, as in the customs, of
the people, there was no break. The apostolic succession
of song continued unbroken from the time
of the Greeks to the time of Schubert. Through all
the mediæval period folk-music was flourishing, growing
in richness and in influence steadily up to the time
when it entered art music by the back door, so to speak,
stealing into the Catholic ritual. For many centuries
the songs of the old world continued in the new. For
the Christian era did not come all at once. It attained
formal dominance when Constantine adopted it
as the official religion of Rome. But it needed many
centuries more before it could attain complete sway
over people’s hearts. Pagan customs and pagan songs
were still living and beautiful. The Christian missionaries
gained their hold over the people by compromising
with the past. The old festivals were not rejected
in favor of the new; they were merged with the
new. Thus Christmas, among the Germanic nations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
was made to absorb an older festival of the turning
of the sun, and the mistletoe, which had had a profound
religious significance for the Pagans became one of
the minor symbols of the Christian feast and continues
to-day an essential part of the Yuletide festivities,
as we know.</p>

<p>And thus it was with the people’s songs. Men’s beliefs
were Christianized, but men’s feelings remained
Pagan. And the two existed side by side for centuries
without trouble. Charlemagne ordered a collection to
be made of German songs (all of Pagan origin) and
did not feel that there was anything impious in his
action. The Pagan was honored along with the Christian
just as, some five centuries later, the Classical
was honored in the Renaissance. But the millennial
year was approaching, when men expected the world
to end, or Christ to come and take personal charge of
his Kingdom. And throughout all Christendom there
arose a desire in men to make themselves perfect
for the second coming. And so arose a mania for exterminating
all that remained of the old world. Charlemagne’s
son, Ludwig the Pious, despised the German
songs his father had collected. And it was so all over
Europe. In these years the last vestiges of Paganism
were stamped out, except for the sweet souvenirs of it
which the institution of the mistletoe and similar symbols
have retained.</p>

<p>Pagan songs of the early Christian period were
mostly in the hands of wandering minstrels and storytellers
who roamed the world in great numbers. These
men, like the songs they sang, were direct descendants
of the Pagan world. One well accredited theory says
that the Italian minstrels were the gladiators of Roman
times, and their descendants. The last of the Roman
gladiatorial shows was held about the beginning of
the fifth century. After that Christian sentiment forbade
these bloody entertainments, and the gladiators,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the entertainers <em>par excellence</em> of Roman times, found
themselves without a means of livelihood. They wandered
from town to town, giving exhibitions of strength
and agility in the market places, just as the acrobats do
to this day in European cities. They became a separate
caste, almost a separate race. Inevitably they
invented or appropriated songs with which to entertain
their admirers between the acts. Some of them became
itinerant merchants, selling molasses or some
other delicacy and attracting the crowds by their music.
Sometimes they had dancing bears, or camels, or
trick monkeys.</p>

<p>In the more serious northern countries—Germany and
England—they were probably the remnants of the old
priesthood. Religion has always needed music as a
support, and the old priests were themselves bards,
or had bards in their service to sing their doctrines.
As they fell into disrepute with the advance of Christianity,
they had to seek their living as best they might,
and they became minstrels, singing the old sagas and
stories which people still loved. Often they became
attached to the service of the courts. The chronicler
Robert Ware says that the battle of Hastings, in which
William the Conqueror subjected the Saxons, was
opened by the minstrel or <em>jongleur</em> Taillefer, attached
to the Norman army, who advanced singing of the
fabulous exploits of some hero of the time and performing
feats of agility with his lance and sword,
which struck terror into the Saxons, who thought his
dexterity must be the effect of witchcraft. But more
often the minstrels were popular entertainers, with a
collection of tricks—hence the name of <em>jongleur</em>,
which means player or trickster, and gives us our English
word ‘juggler.’</p>

<p>Their music had no very exalted status, since it was
only a ‘side-line’ to their merchandise or performance.
But to the people of the time it was as important as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
our orchestral concerts and operas are to us. For it
effected the interchange of art and ideas between province
and province and between nation and nation.
The minstrels were rarely the inventors of the songs
they sang. The music of the time was genuine folk-music
and the minstrels only learned and disseminated
the popular songs. But they represented the whole institution
of secular music in the early Christian age.</p>

<p>In their roving life, the minstrels tended to become
wretchedly immoral. They sometimes formed themselves
into bands for the acting of plays, taking women
along with them, and these bands became the synonym
for dissolute living. Sometimes they were beggars
pure and simple, willing to get money by any means
except working, and purchasable equally to spread a
scandal or commit a murder. They had no home and
no citizenship. In 554 A. D. Childebert promulgated
very stringent laws for the suppression of their licentiousness.
Philip Augustus, King of France, caused
them to be expelled from his domains. They were
outside the law and its protection. For centuries they
were regarded as the evil children of another race. A
citizen might attack or insult a minstrel and the latter
had no recourse in law, except the privilege of striking
his opponent’s <em>shadow</em>. This outlawing of musicians
continued (in the statute books, at least) for
many years. There are traces of it still in certain
lands. Even New York state, it is said, has an unrepealed
statute somewhere in its dusty books authorizing
the arrest of ‘common showmen.’</p>

<p>This prejudice, in the early years, seems to have
been generally justified. The lives of the minstrels
were certainly dissolute. Their personal characters
had all the unattractive qualities of an inferior race—to
dying for money or favor, fickleness and vindictiveness.
They had to truckle to the great, and flatter
the prejudices of the masses. They had, moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the means of making themselves feared by the knights
and barons of whom they demanded money in return
for their music. For if they were allowed to leave
the castle disgruntled, nothing was easier for them
than to spread abroad among the people scandals concerning
the great men and ladies, the tale that Sir
Knight was a wife-beater and that his lady was having
an affair with her page. A certain jongleur, Colin
Muset, who plied his trade in Lorraine and Champagne
in the thirteenth century, once had occasion to sing the
following ditty to the noble of whom he had asked
largess:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>‘Lord Count, I have the viol played<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before yourself, within your hall,</span><br>
And you my service never paid<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor gave me any wage at all;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">’Twas villainy.’</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not difficult to catch the implied threat in these
lines.</p>

<p>But the fickleness and flunkeyism of the minstrels
served them well. When they had been expelled from
France because of their libellous tongues, many of
them were invited over to England by William de
Longchamps, bishop of Ely, who governed the kingdom
during the absence of Richard the Lionhearted,
and who, anxious to blind the people to the vices of
his régime, hired these singers to proclaim his virtues
to the public. Thus art is continually being called
to the glorification of vice and tyranny. But for such
services the minstrels had their reward. So useful did
they make themselves, wherever they went, that they
received increasing marks of respect. When the Christian
revival of the tenth and eleventh centuries came,
they made themselves its apostles, singing the new
songs in place of the old. The acting troupes presented
miracle plays on Biblical or traditional religious
subjects and were presently invited by the clergy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
to perform on the church steps or even within the
church itself. Centuries later they had attained such
dignity that they could organize themselves into guilds
under the protection of the reigning prince. They
had their aristocratic and exclusive labor unions, were
employed to organize town bands, and in many places
formed the nuclei for court orchestras.</p>

<p>Of the music of these minstrels in the early centuries
we know next to nothing. There existed nothing
at the time that could be called musical notation, and
tradition, if it has brought any of their songs down
to us, has changed them in the course of the centuries.
We have, it is true, a spirited song, supposed to have
been written on the death of Charlemagne, calling on
Franks and Romans to lament and honor the lost
sovereign. But this was probably not purely popular
in its origin, else it would not have attained to writing.
The words of a few ditties have been preserved. The
celebrated ‘Song of Roland,’ dating from Charlemagne’s
time, was supposed to have been sung as late
as the battle of Poitiers in 1356. But what chiefly
assures us of the vigor of the popular music of the time
was the wide variety of types it contained—patriotic
songs, love songs, songs satirical and historical, and
many others. We know also that the music was original
and alive, quite in contrast to that of the church.
For when the popular tradition was taken up by the
aristocratic Troubadours and Trouvères in the eleventh
and twelfth centuries, the melodies had an independent
character that proves a vigorous antecedent development.
The old modes continued to dominate church
music up to the fifteenth and even sixteenth centuries.
But the songs of the Troubadours and Trouvères are
often written in the modern major scale. The popular
music of the ninth and tenth centuries had undergone
the development that the church did not attain until
five hundred years later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>We know rather more concerning the instruments
used by the wandering minstrels. They were of all
the types which have since furnished out the modern
orchestra. The harp, a remnant of the very earliest
times, was favored by the more aristocratic musicians
and steadily became enlarged as the technique of music
widened. The lute (much like the modern guitar),
most popular of amateur instruments in the time of
the Renaissance, was widely used. All kinds of pipes,
ancestors of the wood-wind instruments of our orchestras,
flourished in a great variety of styles. And the
incipient violin was represented by the rota, rebek, and
vielle, figuring under a multitude of different names.
Like the Saxon language during the Norman domination
in England, popular music developed in the dark,
without official sanction, finally coming forth, strong
and mature, from its hiding and carrying everything
before it.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>With the approach of the millennial year we find the
beginnings of that institution which was to enframe
all the life of the later middle ages—Chivalry. The
first military games and tourneys appear in the reign
of Charles the Bald, in the ninth century. From that
time on, life became more pretentious, more individual,
more refined. The chivalric ideal was professedly
Christian. It preached what the Pagan could never
have understood—reverence for womanhood and respect
for the weak. Knights gained the church’s special
sanction when they devoted themselves to righting
wrongs and rescuing women in distress. The tender
poetry which in early mediæval times became attached
to the figure of the Madonna, was now extended to all
women—at least to all women of social standing. Because
a woman had been chosen as the Mother of God
all women were regarded as holy in her likeness. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
this changed attitude toward the weaker sex there
came a multitude of delicate shades of sentiment and
an exaggerated devotion that would have seemed childish
to the ancient Greeks. It was common for the
Troubadours to profess the most ecstatic love for some
woman of high rank, who was hardly expected to do
more than smile in return. Love, in its more fanciful
aspects, became the mania of the age.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, that the nobles of the time
took up love, one might almost say, as an avocation.
They had nothing to do, much of the time, but cultivate
the fine arts. They caught the trick of making
verses and melodies. It was natural that love should
be the chief theme of their songs. And in Provence,
the southeastern part of modern France, there arose
toward the end of the eleventh century, the cult or
institutions of the Troubadours. The Troubadours were
primarily nobles, cultivating the arts as a pastime.
But many men of lower rank also took up the fashion,
winning their way through the beauty of their song.
All that we regard as most typical of French art was
in their music and verses—delicacy of wit and fancy,
beauty of form, purity of diction. They represented
the utmost refinement to which their age attained.</p>

<p>They did not, like the jongleurs, accept money for
their singing, though they were proud to receive gifts
from lords and ladies whom they praised. But they
often retained the jongleurs in their service. They seem
to have had ambitions of spreading their reputations
as composers and, as it was unbecoming their rank
to sing in the market-places, they hired jongleurs, as
personal servants, to do it for them. Thus the wandering
minstrel of the ninth century, while losing something
of his artistic preëminence, gained no little in
social dignity. Some gained high reputation. We recall
the story of Blondel, minstrel to Richard the Lionhearted,
who, when his liege lord was a prisoner in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
Germany on his return from the Holy Land, sought him
far and wide and made himself known by his singing
outside the castle, later bringing help and liberty
to his king.</p>

<p>In the north of France flourished the Trouvères, similar
to the Troubadours of the south. They were less
delicate in touch, less polished, but far more serious,
frequently composing, in their own fashion, works of
science and history, theology and philosophy. Among
the Troubadours and Trouvères were Count Guillaume
of Poitiers, Count Thibaut of Champagne, King of
Navarre, and Adam de la Halle. The last named was
not of noble blood, but gained high standing as singer
to the Count of Artois. In Spain, as well as in France,
the institution of courtly song took root and the noble
singers were known as <em>Trobadores</em>. In Italy the singer
was known as <em>Trovatore</em>, though the Provençal song did
not gain much vogue in the land which was being
stirred by the awakening of the Renaissance. The Trouvères,
through the Norman court of London, influenced
the native minstrelsy of England, thus spreading over
half of Europe the fame of the Provençal song.</p>

<p>The variety of artistic forms cultivated by the Troubadours
and Trouvères was great. Of them we can
distinguish the dramatic works, the romances, the
stories or <em>fabliaux</em>, and the lyric works proper. All
of these, excepting, perhaps, the dramatic works, were
at least in part sung to the accompaniment of a musical
instrument. The romances sometimes approximated
the length of epics, extending to 20,000 lines or
more. Of the romances there is one charming and
widely known example in ‘Aucassin and Nicolette,’ a
long story of love and adventure, frequently interrupted
with a lovely song. It is probable that these
romances were recited in a somewhat formal manner
through the more narrative parts, perhaps chanted
in the emotional sections, leading up by means of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
more and more musical delivery to the lyrics, which
undoubtedly had their set melodies. The fabliaux
were short and witty stories, usually satirical when
not actually indecent. The lyrical poems were divided
by their singers into many classes, the distinctions
being largely nominal or fanciful. We can recall the
canzonets, or love-songs, including the serenade (the
‘evening song’) and the aubade (‘morning song’). The
<em>pastourelle</em>, or conventionalized song of shepherd life,
became the Pastoral of the Golden Age of France, one
of the most typical art-forms of the pre-Revolutionary
period. There were further the <em>sirvantes</em>, written to
praise some beneficent prince; the roundelays, with a
set refrain after each verse or stanza; and the dance
songs, intended to be sung actually during dancing.
Then there were the <em>tenzone</em>, contentious songs, usually
in dialog, often set debates on some nice point of
love. Sometimes the <em>tenzone</em> were little masterpieces
of satire. One, composed by a monk, has been preserved
to us. It represents a debate or trial, in which
the monks accuse the women of having stolen the art
of painting invented for ecclesiastical purposes and
having applied it to their cheeks. The women reply
that the monks are no worse off because their sex is
able to cover the wrinkles under their eyes. Finally
St. Peter and St. Lawrence adjudge that the women
shall be allowed from the ages of twenty to thirty-five
to paint in. But, adds the poet, ‘the contract was soon
broken by the women: they lay on more red and
white than was ever used for a votive painting and
have in consequence raised the price of saffron and
other dye-stuffs.’</p>

<p>We should not leave the Troubadours without referring
to the <em>Cours d’amour</em>, or Courts of Love, which
were supposed to have been held, in all solemnity,
during the middle ages. This institution, constituted
like a court of law, heard nice questions as to conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
in love, and gave decisions for one or the other party,
decreeing how the lover and his lady should act in
all conceivable situations. As a matter of fact, it is
extremely doubtful whether such courts were actually
held, but they were at least a fanciful institution of
the time and are represented in many of the songs.
It has been thought by some that the courts were actually
convened and that noble ladies and their courtiers
came from all over Europe to submit the fruits
of their experience and pass upon some such solemn
question as: ‘Is it between lovers, or between husband
and wife, that the greatest affection, the liveliest attachment,
exist?’</p>

<p>At all events, the courts of love existed in the songs
of the Troubadours. For instance, one complainant
brings the following question, presented in the form
of a song by a Troubadour:</p>

<p>‘A knight was in love with a lady who was already
engaged, but she promised him her favor in case she
should ever happen to lose the love of him who was
then her lover. A short time subsequent to this the
lady and her adorer were married. The knight then
laid claim to the love of the young bride, who resisted
the claim, maintaining that she had not lost the love
of him who had become her husband.’ The judgment
in this case was supposed to have been passed by
Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was later to become
the wife of Henry II of England. She refers to a previous
judgment, which is regarded as having all the
force of a precedent in law, and says: ‘We venture
not to contradict the decree of the Countess of Champagne,
who, by a solemn judgment, has pronounced
that true love cannot exist between a married couple.
We therefore approve that the lady in question bestow
the love which she has promised.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Germany, at this time, was hardly behind France
in civilization and refinement of manners. It was
natural, then, that the courtly song should find its way
into Germany. In South Germany—Bavaria and Swabia—the
indigenous folk-song continued to dominate.
But in the northern provinces the influence of the
Trouvères was strongly felt by way of Flanders and
the Lower Rhine. The noble singers here called themselves
<em>Minnesinger</em>—or ‘Singers of Love.’ Their songs
are almost as pure and refined in artistic structure as
those of Provence, but their subject matter is more
earnest and scholarly. In place of the fanciful courtly
compliments paid by the southern French singers to
their ladies, we find that deep and sincere reverence
for womanhood which Tacitus noted among the German
barbarians and which continued through the centuries.</p>

<p>The lyrical songs of the Minnesingers were divided
into three classes: the Lied, or song; the Lerch, or
lay; and the Spruch, or proverb. The difference, musically,
was mainly a matter of form, rigid laws governing
the formation of the strophes. The Lied was the
mostly purely lyrical of the three. The Lerch was
more general in subject-matter, partaking sometimes
of the narrative. The Spruch was essentially one of
the German proverbs which so richly fill the language
even to this day, but it was usually developed to make
a somewhat lengthy stanza. The central idea of the
proverb, its simile or its ethical substance, would be
repeated and enlarged upon, becoming lyrical in character
though retaining the idiomatic directness and
simplicity of the original. Thus the Minnesong tended
to keep a homely character which the Provençal lay
never had.</p>

<p>Among the famous Minnesingers (who were also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
poets in the modern sense) were Wolfram von Eschenbach
and Walther von der Vogelweide. Both are familiar
to all lovers of Wagner. The former is one of
the chief characters in the opera <em>Tannhäuser</em>. He appears
as the pure lover of Elizabeth, in contrast to
Tannhäuser, whose sensual and pagan character is
shown by his affair with the unholy goddess Venus.
In the second act of the opera is shown one of the
tournaments of song which were characteristic of the
age. Tannhäuser, Wolfram, and others, sing the
praises of love, each revealing his personal character
in the attitude he takes toward the great passion. Wolfram
is the genuine Minnesinger, idealizing the object
of his devotion, insisting upon her divinity (her
likeness to the Virgin Mary), and upon the fleshless,
unsensual nature of love in its true estate. One gathers,
also, from a hearing of the opera, that he was a typical
Minnesinger in that his song was something of a
bore. Certainly the Minnesongs, in their ambling
lengthiness, would bring sleepiness to a modern audience.
But Wolfram, we must remember, was not
only a courtly minstrel, but a great epic poet, one of
the great figures in German literature.</p>

<p>Walther von der Vogelweide, perhaps the most inspired
lyricist of his time, figures by name in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>.
Walther, the hero, candidate for the degree
of Meistersinger, is asked who taught him his art. He
replies that he learned it from Walther von der Vogelweide
and from the birds. This causes the Mastersingers
to shake their heads, for inspiration has little
part in their formal music.</p>

<p>The last of the Minnesingers, and one of the most
famous, was Heinrich von Meissen, called Frauenlob—‘Praiser
of Women.’ His songs were so ardent in
their idealization of womanhood that it is related how
the women of Mayence, when the singer died, bore him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
to his grave and poured over it, mingled with their
tears, the richest of Rhenish wines.</p>

<p>Not a few of the songs of the Troubadours, Trouvères,
and Minnesingers have been preserved to us
and have been deciphered with great care by students.
It seems certain that the decipherings are in the main
correct. The songs are well worthy of study. Naumann,
in his ‘History of Music,’ gives four harmonized
according to modern principles. Unlike any of the
church music of the time, these songs are in the modern
major scale. They are, probably, the earliest melodies
preserved to us which seem to have an affinity
with modern music. All music preceding them, as all
the church music following them for at least two centuries,
sounds strange to our ears; we cannot grasp it,
much less enjoy it, without making a conscious allowance
for its seemingly outlandish construction. But
the songs of the courtly minstrels might almost have
been written by Schumann or Brahms. It is possible,
of course, that they have been somewhat modernized
in transcription. But the fact remains that they are
predominantly in the modern major scale and that
their turns of phrase show a feeling for melody as
such in a way never revealed by the church composers
until after Palestrina’s time.</p>

<p>The loveliness of these songs grows on one. We
must, perhaps, make a preliminary allowance for the
length of their lines and for a certain aimlessness
which seems to reside in the melody. The musicians
of the time did not feel accent and metre so strongly
as we do and the regular sing-song of contrasting lines
(which sometimes mars modern lyrics) was hardly felt
in their songs. They flow lightly and smoothly; their
phrases are distinguished by a pause rather than by
a system of balancing and contrasting. They must be
delivered with the utmost repose, in transparent flowing
tones that never betray the breath behind them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
There must be hardly any accentuation and very slight
use of dynamics. Artistic construction, in the more
rigid modern sense, is not to be found in them; they
have no ‘climax point,’ obviously prepared, with passages
leading ‘up to’ and ‘down from’ it. They are
rather like the softest breeze in the morning of a sunny
summer day. They breathe the spirit of the following
lovely verses by Walther von der Vogelweide:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>‘Love is neither man nor woman,<br>
Soul it hath not, nor yet body,<br>
And no earthly sign or token;<br>
Though the tongue of man hath named it,<br>
Never mortal eye hath seen it.<br>
Yet without it can no creature<br>
Win Heaven’s pitying grace and favor;<br>
Nor where love is will there linger<br>
Aught of fraud or baseness ever;<br>
To the traitor, the false-hearted,<br>
Love hath come not, cometh never.’</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But a profound change was coming over society,
which wiped out all vestiges of chivalric song. The
complete failure of the Crusades was one of the obvious
blows dealt the institution of Chivalry. The religious
upheavals against the dominance of the church
of Rome—those of the Hussites in Bohemia, in the
fifteenth century; of the Lutherans in Germany and of
the English under Henry VIII in the sixteenth—these,
apart from their religious aspect, denoted a spirited
rising of the populace to self-consciousness and concerted
action. The spread of knowledge and intellectual
curiosity established lines of communication all
over Europe and diminished the importance of the
courts as centres of culture. With this came a growth
of manufacture and commerce which raised to importance
people very different from the gentle Minnesingers.
In the Germany of the sixteenth century the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
mercantile middle class came to be of social importance,
and around them grew up a new art of song.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The era of the middle-class or Burgher dominance
in the German cities is represented, in music, by the
institution of the <em>Meistersang</em> (master song). The
Meistersang was the middle-class replica of the Minnesang.
It arose shortly after the natural death of the
Minnesang, early in the fourteenth century, originating,
strangely enough, at Mayence, where Heinrich
Frauenlob, the last of the great Minnesingers, died.
The Minnesang, in fact, provided most of the forms
and ideals for the Mastersong—at least in the beginning.
But the era of isolated castles and wandering
minstrels was not that of mercantile Germany, with
strongly walled and independent cities, serving as stopping
places for immense caravans coming from Italy
and the far east. For these cities the merchant and
artisan class held the purse-strings. They were the
urban aristocrats. The Muses had perforce to eat from
their hands.</p>

<p>The Burghers, being not only shrewd and practical,
but prevented by business reasons from wandering
the earth in search of fair ladies, organized their music
in very formal fashion. They held regular singing
contests at which aspiring musicians were heard and
criticized. When these aspirants had proved their ability
both to compose and to sing to the satisfaction of
their elders they were admitted as Mastersingers. But
the examination was rigid and the organization or
guild of the Mastersingers was jealous. Inasmuch as
it controlled the acceptance or rejection of candidates,
it could set the rules. And, being thus constantly called
upon to exercise its superiority, it tended to solidify its
artistic principles into set rules of the most rigid character.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
The verses of each type of song must be organized
in a set way. The music had to be made in
accordance with the accepted practice. Certain transitions
and ornaments were prohibited—not only regarded
as less desirable than others, but ruled out
under all circumstances. At the trials, which were
usually held in the churches, the candidate’s song was
judged by from one to four judges, called Markers,
who were concealed from his view by a curtain. The
judgment was delivered not according to the <em>beauty</em>
of the song, but strictly according to the number of
mistakes the singer had made, with reference to the
rules of the guild. It is hardly to be wondered at, then,
that the songs of the Meistersingers were dry and uninspired.
To musical learning they may have contributed
something. But to the art of music, on its poetical
side, they gave next to nothing. They show, however,
a certain clumsy fancy, as in the titles of the following
songs: ‘Maidenly Grace,’ ‘The Nightingale,’ ‘The
Glutton,’ ‘A Monkey Tune,’ and ‘The Pointed Arrow.’</p>

<p>The institution of the Mastersong, beginning in
Mayence in the fourteenth century, spread over the
greater part of Germany, as far as the Baltic Sea, and
flourished for nearly four centuries. One guild was
in existence at Ulm as late as 1839. The most famous
of all the guilds is of course that of Nuremberg, one
of the richest German cities of late mediæval times.
And the most famous of the Mastersingers is the Nuremberg
poet, Hans Sachs, ‘<em>Schumacher und Poet dazu</em>.’
Sachs, like Wolfram von Eschenbach, is a landmark
in German literature. His output of vigorous homely
poems was enormous, and the support he gave to the
Lutheran Reformation in its early days contributed
in no small measure to its propagation among the simple
people.</p>

<p>But though the mastersong was musically sterile,
the German folk-song, which had been vigorously developing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
through the centuries, now came to brilliant
flower. The Lutheran Reformation was, as we have
said, a popular movement. Without the hearty support
and understanding of the masses it could never
have succeeded. And Luther, understanding this,
sought to draw the congregation as closely as possible
into the church service. His chief means were the
reading of the Bible and the liturgy in the native tongue
instead of Latin, and the congregational singing of
chorales. Hymns, as they are sung now in Protestant
churches, were almost unknown in the Roman church.
Their introduction was a complete innovation of the
Lutheran movement. But Luther understood that congregational
hymns could not be imported from another
country and engrafted on his people. So he
took the folk-songs that were actually being sung by
the people and wrote devotional words to fit them.
He caused many other tunes to be written in the folk-manner
and in all probability wrote some himself
(including the famous ‘Luther’s Hymn,’ ‘A Mighty Fortress
is our God’). These hymns spoke with a familiar
voice of the people and were one of the powerful
sources of strength to the church in its early days of
persecution.</p>

<p>The purely musical results of this introduction of
folk-song into the church service were very great.
From Luther’s time onward the chorale—profound,
dignified, and solemn—was the spiritual basis of German
music. By it German music became emancipated
from the Italian. The German church mothered its
own musicians, greatest of whom was Johann Sebastian
Bach. And the German chorale was one of the
two great influences on later German song. From the
‘Spiritual Songs’ of Johann Sebastian Bach, which are
nothing more than solo chorales, through the songs of
the same name composed by his son, Carl Philipp
Emanuel, to the direct precursors of Schubert, we see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
a direct line of succession. If the German music preceding
Schubert was serious, closely knit, firmly based,
we must lay it in large part to the influence of the
German folk-song which had the same German qualities—and
especially those of simplicity and honesty.</p>

<p>It was not solely in German Protestant music, however,
that popular song became merged. Much earlier
than this time it had exerted its influence on the music
of the Roman church. As early as the fourteenth century
it had become the fashion among church composers
to use popular tunes for their masses. It is
hardly probable that the motive was to draw the people
closer into the church service by giving them a
tune they were familiar with. In fact, the church had
several times been obliged to rule that the people
should not sing in the service, except on certain days,
before and after the ritual. But the church composers
of the thirteenth century and after were in the habit
of writing florid counterpoint around a set melody,
called the <em>cantus firmus</em>, and it became the fashion not
to invent the cantus firmus for one’s self but to borrow
it from any source at hand. In the course of time
composers hit upon the scheme of borrowing secular
tunes. Dufay, at the beginning of the fifteenth century,
used one of the tunes of the people, <em>L’homme
armé</em>, which has been called ‘the most popular tune of
the Middle Ages.’ Such a universal favorite did it become
that it was used in masses by nearly every church
composer from Josquin de Près to Orlando di Lasso.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>It is quite possible that the presence of popular
tunes in church music did something to aid the approach
of the modern major modes (which had already
been widely used by the Troubadours and Minnesingers).
But their influence was at first disguised,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
for the <em>cantus firmus</em> was usually sung very slowly,
in order to allow the florid counterpoint to grow
around it, and hence usually became indistinguishable
to the hearer. Certainly here the popular art had no
such direct and inspiring effect as in the Lutheran revival.
Forces were working slowly toward a great
change in men’s art, as in men’s life and thoughts.
Popular art underwent an eclipse for a time, to emerge
later in a new world, dominant and victorious.</p>

<p>The eclipse came on slowly,—a general twilight all
along the line of battle. Beginning with the twelfth
(even the eleventh) century, men had been experimenting
with counterpoint and polyphony, working out Chinese
puzzles in the combination of two and more
voices. Gradually they learned how to make these
puzzles beautiful as well as ingenious. Then came
the age of the great Catholic church composers, of
whom Orlando di Lasso and Palestrina are the most
famous. With them melody no longer had its former
place. There was much more to think of than the
beauty of a single voice. The whole art was more
austere and more ethereal than popular songs had been.</p>

<p>And the polyphonic art began to dominate secular
music. In place of the fluent melody of the Minnesinger
came the part-song and madrigal. This was
built on the same principles as the sacred mass, but
its character was naturally lighter and more lively in
movement. The part-song was the ‘catch’ of Shakespeare’s
time and its popularity is shown by the frequent
reference to it in Shakespeare’s plays. In
‘Twelfth Night’ Sir Andrew, Sir Toby, and the fool
commence a catch (doubtless known to the audience):
‘Hold thy Peace, Thou Knave,’ Sir Andrew expostulating,
‘How can I begin if I hold my peace?’ The madrigals
were not always of so sportive a character. Sometimes
they were love-songs or songs of nature, showing
keen poetic feeling. Often they were masterpieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
of polyphony and canon. But though much learning
went into their construction, their spirit was that of the
popular song. The most interesting of early part-songs
is one known as ‘Sumer is icumen in,’ a Northumbrian
canon for six voices, which has been proved to have
been composed not later than 1228. It is a delightfully
melodious piece, written in fairly good harmony, in the
major mode, typical of the freedom and gracefulness
of popular music of the time in contrast to the rigor of
the ecclesiastical works. From the early part of the
thirteenth century to the middle of the seventeenth
madrigals were written and were the principal form of
secular vocal music.</p>

<p>During this time, of course, folk-song continued.
But it was, as it had been several centuries earlier,
but a poor relation of music, dwelling among the despised
and rejected of men. It was doubtless during
this period that the earlier specimens of the folk-songs
now preserved to us assumed something like their
present form. But so far as outward history is concerned
secular song is contained in the madrigal (which
is not ‘song’ in our sense), and in the mastersong of
Germany, which was almost wholly lacking in inspiration.
When the homophonic song once more awoke to
its place, the world had experienced the profound
changes of the Renaissance and the Reformation. Secular
life had outstripped the religious in variety and
intellectual interest. The church was powerful still,
but it was no longer the centre of gravity for all men’s
activity. So song found itself drawn into the vortex
and forced to serve men’s pleasures and vanities in
innumerable forms. What these forms were and how
they tended to the Song proper we shall see in the
next chapter.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The last half of the fifteenth century was a period
of unrest and profound change in music. As we have
seen,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> it was in this period that the old pure style of
church music reached its highest perfection under Palestrina,
and, because the resources of the style had been
exhausted, began to give place to the style which we
know as modern. Out of this change grew directly
most of the modern musical forms—the opera, the oratorio,
the independent orchestral piece with its searching
out of instrumental resources, and—the Art-Song.</p>

<p>It is one of the vagaries of history that the Art-Song,
though it commenced with definite consciousness about
the year 1600, did not become a firmly established art
form for full two centuries. By all the signs of the
times it seems as though it should quickly have risen
to maturity. The humanistic enthusiasm of the Renaissance
had sensitized people to individual emotions
and moods—the very material of the art-song. Singing
was universal and had attained a high degree of
technical excellence. And the earliest composers of
opera of the time had hit upon the very principles
which Schubert exemplified two centuries later—the
accurate following of the words by expressive music,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>independent of ‘pattern’ form. But for various reasons,
which we shall examine presently, the art-song
became side-tracked. Within twenty years of its birth
it had been exiled to a dark cellar of history and its
feeble attempts at growth had been smothered by an
institution which presently captured the whole civilized
world—the opera.</p>

<p>So the history of song from 1600 to 1800 is not unlike
that of the five centuries preceding—a delving into
the out-of-the-way places where there is to be found
much that is charming and interesting, but little with
broad and conscious artistic drive. Nevertheless, song
in this period does show organic development. The
outcast infant in the cellar does grow and become
beautiful. But its growth is that of music in general.
As technical materials and artistic consciousness develop,
song partakes of the common benefits, but only
secondarily, here and there, as the servant picks
crumbs from the master’s table.</p>

<p>First of all, in common with music in general, song
partook of the change from the old modes to the
major and minor scales. And here, indeed, it was a
leader rather than a follower. We have seen in the
previous chapter how the folk-songs of Provence and
of the Rhine blossomed into a gentle and flowing major
mode centuries before the ecclesiastical music had
achieved anything like a feeling for the tonic. And
it was perhaps partly because of the introduction of
folk-tunes into church music that the latter presently
began to show evidences of the change. In all countries
we can see how the folk-song, increasing its hold
over conscious composers, began to set the spirit for
all secular music.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>
</div>

<p>In Italy, where the change from the old style to the
new was most marked and dramatic, the art-song grew
gradually out of the madrigal and part-song. While
we have no traces of the folk-song of the sixteenth century,
we know that composers began to write their
part-songs in the folk-spirit. This meant, besides the
predominance of the major mode and the tonic feeling,
a stressing of the upper or ‘melody’ voice, whereas
in the older contrapuntal music it was the tenor which
carried the chief tune. The <em>frottolle</em> of the time were
ballads popular both in words and melody; the <em>villanelle</em>,
or ‘village songs,’ sought to preserve an artless
and rustic flavor; and the <em>villotte</em>, or drinking
songs, were filled with the high spirits for which the
Italians are famous. All these were essentially folk-like
melodies treated contrapuntally. Gradually the
counterpoint became simpler, reflecting perhaps the
growing simplification of church music, and with Perissone
Cambio, in 1547, the part-songs assumed the nature
of melodies harmonized in four parts with a free
use of passing notes—much as in the four-part chorales
of J. S. Bach. The simplification continued, and with
Giacomo Gastoldi, in 1591, we have true ‘chord-for-note’
harmonizations of melodies in the modern style.
With this, the song element has been liberated. The
melody has gained complete mastery, and the harmony
is used simply to enrich and support the upper part.</p>

<p>And as we have seen in another chapter<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> singers
quickly seized the import of the new developments.
As early as 1539 Sileno is recorded to have sung the
upper part of a madrigal, with wind instruments for
the lower voices. Of course these madrigals were still
essentially polyphonic, but the composers of the time
steadily continued to stress the upper voice for its
melodic value and to simplify and suppress the inner
voices until they became a mere harmonic support. It
was this ‘one-voiced madrigal’ which became the parent
of the <em>airs du cour</em> and the simple solo songs and romances
of seventeenth century France.</p>

<p>But the abortive development of the art-song was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>an entirely different matter. It had little or nothing
to do with the tendency to stress a madrigal melody,
or with the liberation of the seventeenth-century romance.
The style called monody, or the <em>stile rappresentativo</em>,
which might have produced a true art-song
in the seventeenth century, was invented or revived
quite in opposition to the madrigal and its spirit. The
one thing it had in common with the new madrigal was
the ‘chord-for-note’ harmonic style. This, thanks to
the popularity of the new madrigal, had become common
property. When the Florentine innovators began
their experiments, they found it ready to hand.
But the true monodic style was, so far as song is concerned,
a wholly abortive affair. Its history has been
traced elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> We know of the painful efforts
toward monody for nearly two centuries previous to
the Florentine experiments; we know of the solo songs
of Vincenzo Galilei in the last decade of the sixteenth
century, and of the songs in Giulio Caccini’s <em>Nuovo
Musiche</em>, published in 1600. We dimly feel that a musical
style devoted to the conscientious reproduction
of the spirit of the words, detail for detail, should have
resulted in a vigorous tradition of art-song. And yet
we see the whole force of monody veering into the
opera, quickly being caught up in the <em>da capo</em> aria
form, and in an unbelievably short time forgetting all
about its early ideals of textual fidelity and serving
only as an exposition gallery for vocal virtuosity.
Within a quarter of a century monody had forsaken
one ideal for its polar opposite. The true ‘representative
style’ had been left high and dry. It remained neglected
and forgotten until Beethoven wrote <em>An die
ferne Geliebte</em>, or Schubert his <em>Gretchen am Spinnenrad</em>.</p>

<p>Why was this? How could an art-form, which had
caught the very essence of the modern song, thus sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
its birthright for a mess of pottage? Reason enough.
The mess of pottage was very attractive. For the
monodic experiments of the Florentines were the play-things
of a set of dilettantes. They were artificial and
exotic. They had consciously no use for the true musical
tradition, the folk-song, which was living and
throbbing among the people. The body was there but
the soul was missing. The Florentines were chiefly
interested in decorating the lives of the aristocracy, in
arranging court masques and private theatricals. Aristocracy
is always weak when it exists in opposition
to and at the expense of the life of the people, as it
did in the decadence of Renaissance Italy. The art
which such an aristocracy produces may be brilliant,
but it is empty. It tinkles and it clatters, but it does
not resound. For the isolated aristocrat is not interested
in humanity, but in his own glorification. The
joys and sorrows of the people are repulsive to him:
he seeks to escape sorrows, and he longs for some more
highly colored joys. He floats on the surface of life
as he floats on the surface of society. His art tends
to become the maximum of show and the minimum
of meaning.</p>

<p>So when the aristocracy of the time discovered the
new monodic style, it sought to make use of it for theatrical
entertainment, neglecting the more human and
personal song. Vocal coloratura provided aristocracy
with precisely the thing it had unconsciously been seeking—the
maximum of show and the minimum of meaning.
The skilled singers of the time caught the trick
of introducing impromptu embellishments on the simple
monodic recitative. Monteverdi hit upon the device
which would give such coloratura singing a centre
of gravity—the <em>da capo</em> form. Monody as heightened
speech was wholly forgotten, except for the debased
<em>recitativo secco</em>, which bridged the gaps between arias,
and tinsel opera became the furore of the leisured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
class. The middle class of Italy, becoming prosperous
in business and always anxious to ape its betters,
flocked to these entertainments as soon as large opera
houses began to spring up, and opera as an institution
overshadowed all other musical forms. The oratorio,
presumably devotional in spirit, became no less debased
in its display. Song, as a great art-form, was
strangled for another century or two, receiving no new
ideals and serving as a mere diversion for composer
and singer. Thus does the easy convenience of abstract
form often stifle poetic expression.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the <em>da capo</em> form and its unfortunate
influence on the monodic style. Strictly
speaking, the term <em>da capo</em> was not used until Tenaglia
used it in his opera <em>Cleano</em>, in 1661. But the ordinary
statement that the <em>da capo</em> was invented by Tenaglia
(or by Alessandro Scarlatti, as is more frequently said)
is quite misleading. Tenaglia’s <em>da capo</em> aria is of little
historical importance. The composer used the term
probably not out of a sense of form, but out of pure
laziness, preferring not to copy out the opening section
a second time. The real <em>da capo</em>, which in its more
developed state becomes the sonata form, can be traced
back vaguely into primitive music, and exists in miniature
perfection in many folk-songs. It becomes a recognized
mold for musical composition about the time
of Monteverdi. With the later opera and oratorio
composers we find it in a debased state, where it exists
not as an artistic form but as a mere stenographic convenience.</p>

<p>This debasement is typical of the cheapening of
opera which continued pretty steadily up to the time
of Gluck. The coloratura aria obscured to all minds
the expressive possibilities of the <em>stile rappresentativo</em>,
and left to song nothing but the old madrigal tradition
fused with certain elements of popular feeling. The
many arias, ariettas, <em>canzoni</em>, <em>cantate</em>, and even one-voiced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
madrigals, which were published by the fashionable
composers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
showed little regard for dramatic or precise emotional
expression, but continued to sing with the placid
lyrical feeling of the great madrigal age. They were
only obliged, with the growth of solo singing, to become
clearer as to form, more regular in metre and line.
For their ability to achieve this they had the popular
song almost wholly to thank. Scarlatti’s beautiful <em>canzonetta</em>,
<em>O cessate di piagarmi</em>, with its simple guitar
accompaniment, might pass for a Neapolitan folk-song
of to-day. Yet, on the whole, the solo songs of this period
failed to fulfill the high artistic promise of the
early seventeenth century.</p>

<p>There was a great quantity of these lyrical pieces,
however, and they gained a high popularity. For the
most part they remain to-day in their original state,
published with the curious notation and the archaic
clefs of the time, unknown except to the savants. But
certain anthologies have presented a few of the songs
to the general public, and these have astonished hearers
with their strange placid beauty. In some ways it is
the best genius of the time which we find in these songs.
In them the lyric impulse of the Italians came out in
its purest form. The flashy ideals of the opera house
were far removed from their tender strains. Their
beauty is like the sunlight of an early spring morning,
which illumines all things and exaggerates none. The
words, though naïve and somewhat conventional in
their continual playing with sentimental love, are not
without their grace and beauty. And the music is remarkably
varied. Among these songs we find lullabies,
fanciful dialogues, dance songs, gentle laments, and
delightful musical jokes. There is among them much
less of pure convention than in the operas of the period,
and at times there is a sensuous or emotional quality
which seems to look forward many decades. To the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
singer these songs are especially valuable, since they
represent at its purest the old Italian ideal of <em>bel canto</em>,
free from either declamatory or coloratura influence.
There can be no better school for the formation of
purity of tone and fluency of phrasing than these early
<em>canzoni</em>.</p>

<p>Their general character, as contrasted with that of
modern music, is strikingly illustrated in Strauss’s
opera <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em>. In the first act of this work
the court musician sings a few strophes of a song which
is supposed to be of the period of the opera, and the
composer has deftly imitated the music of the time.
The song shows no touch of emotional agitation or
harshness. It has no climaxes, scarcely any variations
of tonal power. It is merely a lovely melody, sung
purely and smoothly, somewhat aimless in melodic
formation, in long fluent phrases and gentle melancholy
cadences. To hear this <em>canzone</em>, contrasted with the
agitated modern music which surrounds it in the opera,
will demonstrate most eloquently the spiritual difference
between the music of the seventeenth and that of
the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The song composers of this period are those whose
names we meet in the history of opera and oratorio,
for it continued to be the part of every popular composer
in the larger forms to maintain and broaden his
reputation by means of small and popular pieces. Further,
some of the best of the songs are taken from the
larger works. Not all the arias were of the coloratura
type. Often, especially in the seventeenth century,
charming <em>canzoni</em> and ariosos found their way into a
long choral or stage work. The harmonic support (in
many cases supplied by the modern editors from the
original figured bass) is at the beginning simple and
somewhat angular. But as the seventeenth century
wears on we find Monteverdi’s great discovery of the
unprepared dissonance working more freely into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
texture of the accompaniment. The lower voices of
the accompaniment become more connected and song-like
as the <em>rappresentativo</em> feeling gives way to the
lyrical. And long before the end of the century the
simpler vocal numbers begin to look very much like
those of the early Handel operas. With Alessandro
Scarlatti, working at the end of the century, the change
from the madrigal style of Palestrina’s time is complete.
In place of pure, motionless triads and solid,
block-like architecture, we have the movement and
flow of song in all the parts. Music becomes sharply
differentiated in character by the nature of the emotion
or feeling it is intended to express. What we miss,
judging by modern standards, is a definite rise and fall
of the feeling. The phrases seem too long, too little
differentiated. There is no definite climax-point in the
whole. There is too much linked sweetness. But this
is precisely the virtue of the songs. They are the canonization
of <em>bel canto</em>. They seek before all else perfect
purity of tone and style.</p>

<p>From the Monteverdi operas, much talked-of but little
known, we should mention the famous arioso from
<em>Arianna</em>, the so-called ‘Ariadne’s Lament.’ In all the
Italian music of the time no more poignant emotional
utterance can be found. In its freedom and directness,
it seems to be a foreshadowing of the opera of the late
nineteenth century. But as the line of opera composers
continues the pure <em>bel canto</em> ideal gains the upper
hand. This we find represented in the one-voiced madrigals
of Monteverdi’s contemporaries, as, for example,
in the charming <em>Amarilli</em> of Caccini. Cavalli, who continued
the operatic tradition of Monteverdi and gave
greater freedom to the aria, gives us a type of song
which contains many elements of the popular. Carissimi,
first writer of oratorios and founder of the great
Italian coloratura tradition, writes more brilliantly.
One of the best known songs of the time is his <em>Vittoria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></em>,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
which has an irresistible verve and energy.
Marco Antonio Cesti, follower and disciple of Carissimi,
was by nature more of a lyricist. His style is
wonderfully suave and melodious, often appealing in
a striking way to the sentiments and the senses.
Though he was primarily a religious composer, his
many madrigals and secular ariettas bring to us the
sunny sensuousness of the south. Many more of the
popular composers of the time are all but unknown
to us.</p>

<p>Antonio Caldara (1671-1763), a <em>maestro di capella</em>
in Mantua and Vienna, wrote secular songs, of which
one, <em>Come raggio di sol</em>,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> has preserved his fame. This,
with its fine sostenuto melody over a throbbing accompaniment
of repeated chords, carries eloquently a
delicate rise and fall of feeling which seems to be of
the age of Schubert. A certain G. B. Fasolo, whose
dates are not even known, has left us a charming song
of sentiment, <em>Cangia, cangia tue voglie</em>, which in its
delicacy of workmanship suggests the French songs of
the eighteenth century. Giovanni Battista Bassani
(1657-1716), <em>maestro di cappella</em> at Bologna and Ferrara,
left a number of love-songs of exquisite grace
and tenderness, of which the lullaby, <em>Posate, dormite</em>,
will serve as an example. Other song-writers, most of
them more or less known for their work in the larger
forms, were Antonio Vivaldi, Alessandro Stradella,
Francesco P. Sacrati, Paolo Magni, Jacopo Perti, Antonio
Lotti, Niccola Jomelli, Domenico Sarri, Raffaello
Rontani, Benedetto Marcello, Pier Domenico Paradies,
Francesco Gasparini, Andrea Falconiere, Francesco
Durante, G. B. Bononcini, Arcangelo del Leuto, and
S. de Luca. Some of these men are no more than
names in musical history, who are known at all only
because some dusty manuscript preserved their fame.
For some the primary biographical facts are missing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>
<p>Others, of course, were men of wide influence, who have
made a place for themselves in musical history. But
the excellence of the work of the obscure men reveals
to us how widespread was the art of musical composition
at the time, how excellent the tradition that was
rooted in the whole nation.</p>

<p>Easily the greatest song-writer of the period was the
distinguished opera composer, Alessandro Scarlatti.
He was a notable innovator in many forms, and this
power of origination is shown in the poetic variety he
has given to his songs. We have already mentioned
his folk-like song, <em>O cessate di piagarmi</em>, which combines
with the grace of the dance the sweetness which
invites to tears. In a quite different vein nothing could
be finer than <em>Su, venite a consiglio</em>, in which the author
holds a dialogue with his Fancies—a smoothly-moving
allegro of the utmost delicacy. Scarlatti’s emotional
style is represented in the arietta, <em>Sento nel core</em>,
and as a pupil of the worldly Carissimi he can, of
course, show numberless arias in the brilliant bravura
style which was so popular at the time.</p>

<p>Pergolesi, the brilliant composer of <em>opera buffa</em>,
whose early death robbed music of one of its most
promising votaries, is known to singers everywhere by
his song <em>Tre giorni</em>. The purest Italian lyricism also
flows in his andantino song, <em>Se tu m’ami, se sospiri</em>.
Coming down to a later date we find the extremely
popular song-writer and composer of <em>opera buffa</em>,
Giovanni Paesiello (1741-1816), whose arietta, <em>Caro
mio ben</em>, is one of the purest examples of <em>cantilena</em> in
all music. We may also notice the delicate gypsy song,
<em>Chi vuol la Zingarella</em>. In Paesiello we find all the traditional
Italian virtues in the highest degree—simplicity,
grace, expressiveness—together with a sympathetic
understanding of the voice which has rarely been surpassed
in Italian song-writing.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>One thing, however, the ‘representative style’ had
contributed to song, in common with all other forms
of seventeenth century music. This was the unprepared
dissonance in harmonic writing. The dissonance,
which gave immensely greater freedom to the leading
of voices, provided especially a means of poignant
emotional expression, wholly lacking in the old church
music. And such art-songs as were written in the
seventeenth century made a limited use of the dissonance,
particularly the dominant seventh, which enabled
it to keep mildly abreast of musical progress.</p>

<p>In Germany, in the early part of this century, Hans
Leo Hassler (1564-1612) was the chief exponent of
song. Hassler had studied in Italy and brought back
to his native land something of the Latin lightness of
touch, as well as the technical innovations which he
had seen in process of development during his student
days. At his hands the heavy and earnest German
folk-song became lighter and the melody more prominent,
especially in his dance songs. About this time
many song collections made their appearance, testifying
to the growing popularity of solo song. But it
was Heinrich Albert (1604-1651) who gave the true
national touch to German song and justified the title
which later generations have given him, ‘Father of the
German Lied.’ Germany, in the early part of the
seventeenth century, was suffering from the effects of
severe religious wars and was in one of its periodic
states of national and cultural depression. Placed as
it was in the centre of enemies, disrupted in political
adherence and torn by fratricidal quarrels, it was peculiarly
liable to lose its indigenous culture and to
adopt its manners and art from surrounding nations.
This was its estate in the first half of the seventeenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
century, when the ‘poet patriots’ sought to revive national
spirit in poetry. The group had much in common
with that of more than a century later<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which
sought the same renaissance of German national life,
but the time was not yet ripe for their full success.
Germany was disrupted spiritually as well as politically
and for still another century French letters and
art dominated the upper classes. But beneath the
superficial culture of the aristocracy there was the true
national life of the common people, the force which
has kept Germany one through darkest days and
nights and has in the last fifty years brought to fruition
such a glorious era of national culture. And it
was to the folk-element in German culture that the
‘poet patriots’ were forced to appeal. Heinrich Albert,
in setting to music the poems of this group, chose
the German folk-song style, rather than that of the
Italian aria. By this choice he made his work count
for something in history. He may be called (at least
so far as Germany is concerned) the creator of the
<em>volkstümliches Lied</em>. This is the song which we meet
with continually in the next century and a half—the
song which is composed consciously and with a definite
artistic effect in mind, but with the materials which
are common to the people and capable of being understood
by all. The ‘folk-like’ song, in fact, becomes
a goodly share of the folk-song treasury of the succeeding
generation. At its best it is little below true
folk-song in quality. Often it fills a whole gap in the
life of the people which true folk-song had neglected
to fill. We may get a very fair estimate of the place
of Heinrich Albert’s <em>volkstümliches Lied</em> in the life
of the people if we recall the work of Stephen Foster
in America,—a work which is now the common property
of people from one end of the land to the other.</p>

<p>But, as we have said, German national life was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>vigorous in the seventeenth century, and the work of
the ‘poet patriots’ passed into comparative oblivion.
Italian opera quickly became established in all the
court centres of Germany, and its ideals, nurtured
especially by Reinhard Keiser in Hamburg, dominated
the conscious musical life of the nation. French refinement
entered in, to the detriment of indigenous art.
The songs of the time, written by J. G. Graun (1698-1771),
G. P. Telemann (1681-1767), Agricola, and
others, were called odes and arias, imitating the French
and Italian names as they imitated the French and
Italian forms, and the <em>volkstümliches Lied</em> as well as
the true art-song was again in disrepute. We should
mention, however, the few secular songs of J. S. Bach,
which reveal, in spite of their lack of originality in
form, a delicate poetic sense, especially in the little
love-song, <em>Bist du bei mir</em>. For the true art-song Germany
had to wait until it had achieved some amalgamation
of the social and cultural life of the nation.</p>

<p>Much the most grateful song literature of the long
transition period is to be found in France. There,
Gallic taste restrained opera from the worst excesses
of the Italian school, while the French sense of grace
and proportion produced a multitude of trifles which
have by no means lost their charm to this day. Moreover,
as the eighteenth century wore to a close there
arose a wonderful tradition of patriotic and idealistic
songs which outshone the similar songs of Germany
in brilliance if not, on the whole, in stark emotional
power.</p>

<p>At the end of the sixteenth century the folk-songs
of France, like those of England, were still largely in
the modal scales. But this was not in imitation of
ecclesiastical music. Folk-songs have borrowed very
little from church music, in any age, while the debt
on the other side is enormous. The modal character
of the early folk-songs is proper to them and extends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
back far into the early morning of music. If church
and folk-music were similar in their scales, it is rather
because they arose from a common stock. Certainly
the songs of early France were thoroughly of their
own and not of any borrowed character. But the
universal trend toward a standard major scale and a
tonic centre was felt in France as in other countries,
and by the end of the sixteenth century was well developed.
The folk-tunes of the time were vigorous
in the extreme, probably as little like the dainty and
restrained songs of modern France as the stolid songs
of nineteenth century England were like the Elizabethan
songs, with their abounding energy. The Lutheran
movement in music, which adapted folk-tunes
as settings to devotional hymns, found an exact parallel
in France as early as 1539, when Marot translated the
psalms into metrical form in the vulgar tongue and
set them to the songs of the street. The settings instantly
became popular. It is said that the court, being
fascinated with the freshness of the songs, became
thereby more familiar with scripture than it had been
for many a year. The strict church party violently
disapproved of the practice and issued its own set of
rival songs to stem the tide of popularity, but even
these, which were obliged to be popular in character,
only added to the vogue of the street-tune settings.
In the following century the same thing happened in
the political field. The Cardinal Mazarin, who was
immensely unpopular among the people, was made the
butt of endless satires in verse set to tunes which
everybody knew. No fewer than four thousand of
these ‘Mazarinades’ were later collected and published.</p>

<p>The songs of the late sixteenth century, apart from
folk-songs, were largely dance tunes set to lively words
and supported with a polyphonic accompaniment. But
slowly the polyphony became more simple and in the
beginning of the seventeenth century the ‘chord-fornote’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
accompaniment was adopted from Italy and came
to most charming flower. With the French sense of
grace and fitness the French composers made their
<em>airs du cour</em>, or ‘court tunes,’ lyric and flowing, keeping
the accompaniment in its proper place as a mere
support to the melody and rounding off the pieces
by means of a subtle and satisfying architecture. The
many names under which the French aristocratic songs
went are hardly to be distinguished with definiteness.
The term <em>airs du cour</em> covered almost any songs of a
restrained, polished character. The <em>chanson</em> was
nearer the people, sometimes a ballad, very often a
dance tune, and not infrequently a gross or indecent
piece of little artistic value. The <em>romance</em>, which dates
from the Troubadours, was touching and graceful,
almost wholly confined to the tender sentiments. The
<em>brunette</em> was a simple love song, not very distinct in
genre, the very name being a matter of doubt. The
<em>bergerette</em>, in which class belong some of the most delightful
of French songs, was a lyric of pretended pastoral
nature, in which lovers carried on their romances
in the guise of shepherds and shepherdesses. The
<em>musette</em> was written in supposed imitation of a street
organ, invariably over a ‘drone bass,’ usually in fifths.
The <em>vaudeville</em>, less distinguished in character than
any of the others, was a mere adaptation of current
street tunes (whence the name, <em>voix de ville</em>). These
types of song found their way in great abundance into
later French opera, especially that admirable achievement
of the French, the <em>opéra comique</em>, and many of
the best French songs of the eighteenth century are
to be found in opera scores. But in the operas of
Lully, the chief French dramatic composer of the
seventeenth century, the lightness of touch which distinguishes
the French had not yet come into its own
and the somewhat ponderous classic tradition still dominated.
Songs during this period were usually written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
independently, but they grew in popularity so steadily
that the composers of light opera in the following century
were forced to include one or more <em>romances</em>, <em>brunettes</em>,
or <em>bergerettes</em> in their works to insure their
popularity.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In Elizabethan England in the sixteenth century the
strolling minstrels and ballad singers had already
largely adopted the Ionian or major mode for their
songs. This mode was in high disfavor among the educated
musicians of the time, who called it <em>il modo lascivio</em>,
the ‘lascivious mode.’ It is interesting to recall
that the Greeks, including Plato, brought the same
charge against their Lydian mode, which was the one
of the four original modes which was most predominantly
major in its feeling. In the England of Elizabeth
and James the madrigal had nearly as much vogue as in
Italy and the madrigal writers, chief among whom was
Orlando Gibbons (1583-1625), were highly regarded.
Not a few of the solo songs from this period have continued
in favor to this day, but the more familiar ones
were in most cases the work of educated composers
writing in the popular style. In fact, the pure English
folk-song was so inhospitably received among its own
folk during the Commonwealth and after, that, until
recently, it was popularly supposed that England had
no folk-song of consequence. But the folk-songs were
there and have continued from generation to generation
through the centuries, to be discovered of late years
by conscientious investigators. Though they are dying
out in modern industrial England, they still exist in
such numbers and of such distinctive beauty that they
prove, more than all records can, the genuine musical
quality of the England that existed before the great
Rebellion. From among the ‘folk-like’ songs of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
period we have, preserved in full popularity, a number,
notably the ‘Carman’s Whistle,’ ‘The British Grenadiers,’
‘The Bailiff’s Daughter of Islington,’ the ‘Willow’
song which Shakespeare introduced into ‘Othello,’ and
‘The Friar of Orders Gray.’</p>

<p>During the Commonwealth secular music flourished,
but chiefly on the Royalist side, since the Puritans, in
their idle moments, were largely engaged in singing
hymn tunes. From this period we have the stirring
song ‘When the King Enjoys His Own Again.’ With
the return of the Stuarts and the reign of Charles II
the influence of France, where Charles had spent his
years of exile, became dominant. The dance, not the
dance of the people but the stately dance of the court,
asserted its sway over song, and the flesh and blood,
which had throbbed so richly in Elizabethan England,
all but dropped out of the later English product. The
songs which are preserved from the period occurred
chiefly in the masques which were performed at court,
which were French to the core. The chief song writer
of the time, and of that just preceding, was Henry
Lawes (1595-1662), who wrote the music to Milton’s
immortal masque of ‘Comus.’ Lawes was a true musician,
though not a great one, and he did much for
English song in making the music respect the poetry.
He loosened formal bonds and introduced something
of the Italian recitative style. Along with the Restoration
we have semi-folk-songs of a light character,
though without the freshness of preceding decades.
We may mention two of the most popular, ‘Come,
Lasses and Lads,’ and ‘Barbara Allen.’ Pelham
Humphrey (1647-74), whom Charles II sent to France
to study under Lully, brought back to England with
him the French grace and refinement and helped to
set the keynote for English song for the next half century.
This much the returned Stuart dynasty did for
English music, in bringing French traditions across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
Channel, but the more stolid English disposition of
the time never hospitably absorbed the new influence.
And in 1688 the Stuarts were ushered out to the strains
of a most remarkable tune, ‘Lilliburlero.’ Of this song
it has truly been said that it ‘drove King James II out
of England.’ It was not a patriotic or warlike song,
however, but merely a satire. The ribald words may
seem the worst of doggerel to us now, but their rough
satire awakened all England when the impudence of
the Stuarts had become unbearable and the energetic
melody carried them in a flash from one end of the
country to the other. The upheaval of 1688 was the
‘bloodless revolution.’ King James succumbed to laughter.</p>

<p>And, curiously enough, this loose and somewhat commonplace
tune introduces us to the greatest and most
sincere of all English musicians (unless recent years
have produced his peer) and to the song writer of
whom, above all others, England has a right to be
proud. This man was Henry Purcell. The tune of
‘Lilliburlero’ was written as an innocent dance in a
book of virginal pieces and thence was brought into
the open air to support the high spirits of the satiric
verses. It is quite certain that Purcell never intended
himself to be made immortal when he wrote it, or to be
an instrument in the downfall of King James, to whom
he wrote one of his many ‘odes.’ But into some of his
other songs he put the best he had. They are graceful
in the extreme, often decorated with the vocal turns and
embellishments which were the fashion of the day, but
never lacking in the musician’s touch. Their melodic
facility is charming; their appropriateness to the spirit
of the words is convincing; and their delicate architecture
makes them, apart from their vocal quality, polished
works of art. Purcell still frequently (and justly)
appears on song programs. Among his many lyrics
which are worth knowing we may mention ‘Full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Fathom Five’ and ‘Come Unto These Yellow Sands,’ to
Shakespeare’s words, and ‘I Attempt from Love’s Sickness
to Fly.’</p>

<p>But after Purcell English music showed a falling off
in originality and spontaneous quality which has astonished
and mystified historians. And English song
suffered the same fate along with the rest of English
music. Vigorous semi-folk-songs date from the early
eighteenth century—notably ‘Down Among the Dead
Men,’ ‘The Vicar of Bray,’ and ‘Pretty Polly Oliver’—but
as the century progressed the song output became more
and more vapid and superficial in spirit. This was
doubtless in part due to the vogue of Italian opera
which held fashionable England fascinated and smothered
the creative work of native composers. And as
people became disgusted with the fad they turned to
the next best thing at hand, the ‘ballad opera.’ This
was not a very exalted form of art, but it was at least
fresher and more musical than the exaggerated vocal
virtuosity of opera, with its conventionalized arias and
its ‘castrati,’ or male sopranos. The ballad opera came
into fashion in 1727, with the enormous success of
‘The Beggar’s Opera,’ a success comparable to that of
‘Pinafore’ a century and a half later. The ballad opera
was strictly not opera at all, but only a lively and merry
farce (often suggesting the operetta librettos of Sir William
Gilbert) interspersed with songs and duets. These
songs were at first but popular melodies of the street or
countryside, adapted to new words, assuring the popularity
of the opera because the tunes were favorites. As
the number of native tunes seemed insufficient to supply
the enormous number of ballad operas, the writers
engaged well-known musicians to write original tunes
in the same manner—sometimes as many as eight or
ten composers for one work. The songs never appeared
as organic parts of the action and hence offer
no analogy to the arias of true opera, but they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
usually made vaguely appropriate to the dramatic situation
and were introduced in such a way as not to
seem out of place. Among the host of these melodies
which have come down to us there are indeed many
which are fresh and attractive. But the great majority
have the cheapness of the street without its abundant
life. And they nearly always have a strain of the extreme
sentimentality which has remained a blot on
English song literature until recent times. On the
whole, if the ballad operas delivered England from the
pompous inanities of the Italian craze, they also seduced
English taste from the exquisite manner of Purcell.
The better part of musical England turned to
the noble oratorios of Handel and against his thundering
chords all minor lyric strains were fruitless.</p>

<p>The song writers of eighteenth-century England are
a depressing crew. Henry Carey (1685-1743), to whom
the melody of ‘God Save the King’ has been attributed,
was a fruitful writer of ballad operas, though he is
nowadays best known by ‘Sally in Our Alley,’ a tune
which is the essence of awkwardness—a tune, in short,
which could have happened nowhere but in eighteenth-century
England. Thomas Arne (1710-78) was much
more of a musician and a scholar, but also much of a
pedant. Even such a dainty song as ‘Where the Bee
Sucks’ is marred by its awkward overlaying of <em>fiorituri</em>.
The song by which Arne is best known, ‘Rule Britannia,’
is indeed a stirring melody; but the fact that a man
of Arne’s standing could write such a tune to the given
words and that England could accept the two as belonging
together proves to what a depth the country
had sunk in musical matters. We need only quote the
first line:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe20" id="score-p171">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Wagner said that this phrase contained the whole spirit
of the English people. But what about the words and
that ridiculous ‘fir-r-r-r-rst?’ Samuel Arnold (1740-1802),
Charles Dibdin (1745-1814), James Hook (1746-1827),
and John Davy (1764-1824) need only be mentioned
and forgotten. Henry Bishop (1788-1855) was
a man of more artistic sense and a composer of graceful
and emotional melody, but without his operas he would
scarcely be remembered. The tradition of awkward
and sentimental melody which these men established
or maintained continued to disgrace English song until
the close of the nineteenth century and even to-day in
the half-conscious English popular ballad we seem to
hear the debased strains of the ballad opera.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>During all this period song, as we have tried to show,
was under a cloud. It was the aria, illegitimate child
of the <em>stile rappresentativo</em> and dearest daughter of
sunny Italy, that held sway over the nations. Vocal
music was commonly thought in terms of the aria.
All else was little better than a diversion for an idle
moment—understood, of course, that we are speaking
of polite culture. What aria meant to the seventeenth
and especially to the early eighteenth century was
chiefly vocal display of one sort or another. But
formally we may distinguish it by the <em>da capo</em> form.
<em>Da capo</em>, meaning ‘from the beginning,’ was the open
sesame into the mazes of vocalization. Monteverdi
must get the credit for it. He lit the fire. Numerous
rubbish piled on by other hands furnished the smoke.
For Monteverdi was, above and beyond the innovator
in him, a skilled and sensitive musician. He felt, and
felt truly, that the <em>stile rappresentativo</em> made his beloved
music decidedly a second best. Very well to reveal
the emotional qualities of the text! But if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
music cannot itself hang together there is something
wrong. And it was with one of those very keen and
very simple devices that Monteverdi righted matters.
‘Represent’ your text to your heart’s content, he said,
but before you have done go back and sing a little of
the beginning over again. Thus you give the musician
a chance; for you mark off the music as something
having its own architecture. And, moreover, you ‘represent’
all the more truly, for you mark off at the same
time the lyrical emotion and make a musical unit of
what is properly also a unit of drama. This Monteverdi
did in simplest terms in the first of arias—‘Ariadne’s
Lament,’ in his opera <em>Arianna</em>, and this same
Lament, it is recorded, very properly moved the audience
to tears. The aria is beautiful still. Monteverdi’s
dissonances have not lost their emotional expressive
value. And the <em>da capo</em> repetition, which enters so unobtrusively,
underscores the emotion as nothing else
could. But Monteverdi was not the inventor of this
form. Needless to say the folk-song had been there
before him. And, as always happens, when the art of
the people had been commandeered for a single well-chosen
one of its treasures, it gave gold where silver
had been asked.</p>

<p>Nevertheless gold can be put to base uses. Scarcely
had dilettantes discovered that the <em>da capo</em> form could
be used to give unity to some vocalist’s singing than
they used it to give form to all sorts of formless things.
We cannot at this distance imagine the vapidity of endless
runs and roulades which passed in the seventeenth
century for vocal music. Or at least we cannot until
we see the actual fact on a cold printed page. And
then, to do the seventeenth century justice, we cannot
imagine the brilliancy of these same runs and roulades
when brilliantly sung with the incomparable Italian
vocal art of the time. Brilliancy of a kind! Let us call
it brilliancy merely, and not plague it with the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
of music. However that may be, we certainly cannot
imagine the hold this institution of the aria had over
the imaginations of the people of the time. To them
it must have seemed the Muses on wings as compared
with the Muses on foot. Aria became a science. More,
it became a code of honor. Its nuances and conventions
were tabulated as nicely as those of fencing or love
making. A sin against the code was the unforgivable
sin. There were, scientifically accredited, certain
classes of arias with certain subdivisions thereunto appertaining.
An opera must contain so many of each
sort. Each major singer must have so many, no two
alike and all equitably distributed. No aria must fall
in the same class as that just preceding. There were
many rules such as these, and more of the same sort
which are well buried in dusty dictionaries. And if
there were any to protest against such a condition they
were promptly silenced by the statement that the arrangement
was excellent for the singers.</p>

<p>Those who studied this deep subject most profoundly
at the time agreed that the aria was to be divided into
some five classes, to wit: <em>aria bravura</em>—brilliant, rapid,
difficult; <em>aria cantabile</em>—smooth, long drawn out, designed
to exhibit purity of tone and manipulation of
the breath; <em>aria buffa</em>—humorous; <em>aria di portamento</em>—simple
in outline, playing with the singer’s trick of
swelling out on long-sustained tones; and <em>aria parlante</em>—simulating
rapid spoken speech, a type peculiarly
grateful to the Italian language. These classes had
their subdivisions, as, for instance, the <em>aria parlante</em>,
which might be <em>agitata</em>, or <em>infuriata</em>, or <em>fugata</em>, or what
not. The lore of aria was endless. Except that the
form continued into Italian opera of the middle nineteenth
century it would scarcely be worth recalling.
But the greatest of the arias (with considerable musical
value added) are among the latest. The ‘Factotum’
aria which opens Rossini’s ‘Barber of Seville’ is a perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
example of the <em>buffa</em> and might also come under
the head of the <em>parlante</em>; and Leonora’s first aria in
<em>Il Trovatore</em> is in the true manner of the <em>bravura</em>.
In addition to the arias proper we should mention the
<em>cavatina</em> and the <em>arioso</em>; the former a short aria, rather
more musical and graceful than was considered necessary
in the longer forms; and the latter a brief lyrical
strain, free as to form, planned truly to express an
emotion in its momentary passing. All these forms
have little more than an archeological interest to us
now (though the <em>da capo</em> idea remains one of the most
fruitful in all music), except for the purposes of vocal
study. But this exception is considerable. The arias
were designed to exhibit the utmost of vocal virtuosity.
They serve to-day to develop and exercise the same,
so far as modern music and musical taste demand it,
for the rather more artistic purposes of the twentieth
century.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The ‘odes’ and ‘arias,’ which in early eighteenth-century
Germany stood in the place of songs, began to
give place toward the middle of the century to music
of a more national character. The work of Johann
Sebastian Bach, though not widely recognized at the
time, spoke for a solid tradition of native German singing.
And the wars of Frederick the Great, who reigned
from 1740 to 1786, did much to arouse patriotism in
outward life. Any vigorous cultural life in Germany
during these wearing conflicts was, of course, impossible,
but after the close of the Seven Years’ War (1756-63)
Prussia and Saxony began to revive, and with them
revived a consciousness of German nationality and German
identity. The courts were, of course, thoroughly
Parisian, but the middle class was more than ever national
in feeling. And among this class in the last third
of the century arose a type of dramatic entertainment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
which corresponded to the <em>opéra comique</em> in France
and was quite as national—the <em>Singspiel</em>. The founder
of this type was Johann Adam Hiller (1728-1804), first
director of the famous Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra
and one of the most noted musicians of his day. The
<em>Singspiel</em> was not greatly unlike the English ballad
opera in form, though much more sincere in spirit. It
was a simple play, usually light in character, with frequent
interspersing of songs and choruses. The plot
was usually drawn from German village life and the
characters were all familiar types. These were, on the
whole, so truly observed that the <em>Singspiel</em> became a
truly national art. Moreover, its artistic value was
often high; the songs and choruses were usually organic
parts of the action, and the best musicianship
frequently went into their composition. The <em>Singspiel</em>
was the direct parent of German opera, as has been narrated
in another place.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But its value to the art of
song was even more important. For, while in the <em>Singspiel</em>
the nobles and aristocratic characters sang arias
modelled on the French style, the peasants and middle
class people sang true songs in the spirit of folk-music.
Accordingly the <em>Singspiel</em>, with its immense popularity,
spread abroad the knowledge and love of the German
<em>volkstümliches Lied</em>. It was for more than a quarter
of a century the direct continuer of the tradition of
German song.</p>

<p>But Hiller’s place in the history of song is even more
distinctive than this. For he is generally conceded to
have been the first composer of the <em>durchkomponiertes
Lied</em>. <em>Durchkomponiert</em>, which literally means ‘composed
all the way through,’ is used to describe that type
of song which does not follow any abstract formal
scheme but fits the words in all their variations of
meaning, leaving each song to find its own form according
to its own requirements. Thus the aria form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>which would require the repetition of the first section at
the close of the song would be wholly unsuitable for a
poem which showed an emotional development from joy
to sorrow, or from sorrow to joy. In the same way the
strophic form, which sets each verse of the poem to the
same tune, would be unsuitable for a poem expressing
contrasting emotions in its verses. A true regard for
the spirit of the words required that the song composer
should be free to write expressive music according to
the requirements of each line of the poem. This was
first done, tentatively enough, it is true, by Hiller. From
that time on German song writers showed a certain
amount of freedom in their song forms. It must be
admitted that they did not make much use of their
freedom, since they did the greater part and the best
part of their work in the strophic form. But Hiller has
the credit of originating a type of procedure which
was further developed by Beethoven and brought to
glorious fruition by Schubert.</p>

<p>Gluck, with his unfailing artistic sense, has supplied
a bit of the literature of song development in his letter,
written in 1777 to La Harpe, accompanying his settings
of some of Klopstock’s poems, in which he said that
‘the union between air and words should be so close
that the poem should seem made for the music no
less than the music for the poem.’ Unfortunately, however,
these ‘odes,’ the only true songs Gluck wrote, are
dry and pedantic. Joseph Haydn, though he contributed
nothing to the development of the art-song, has
left a few lyric settings that are known and loved to-day.
His earlier sets of songs (one group of twelve in
1781 and another in 1784) were so popular in England
that he was besieged by the publishers with requests
to write more. The result was the twelve famous ‘canzonets,’
of which the best known are the ‘Mermaid’s
Song’ and ‘My Mother Bids Me Bind My Hair.’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>latter, though still undimmed in musical beauty, is by
no means a step in a forward direction. It is written
in true aria style and the melody, while appropriate to
the spirit of the words, is almost instrumental rather
than vocal. The song might, in fact, have served as
the allegretto to a symphony.</p>

<p>The other supreme German composer of the time,
however, saw to the heart of the <em>durchkomponiertes
Lied</em> and produced at least one song that wholly anticipated
Schubert. Mozart published in all thirty-four
songs that can justly be distinguished from arias. Most
of them, like ‘The Song of Freedom,’ are little different
from the ordinary strophic songs of the day. But Mozart’s
setting of Goethe’s poem, ‘The Violet,’ is a miniature
masterpiece of the art-song.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Retaining the delicate
sense of architecture which Mozart’s work never
lost, it still follows the import of the words with faithful
accuracy. The violet loved a maiden who came daily
to walk in the meadow. It hoped that she would notice
it. She never did. But one day she stepped on it and
crushed it. And the violet was happy to meet its death
through its loved one. The short, gasping phrases on
the words <em>es sank, es starb</em> (‘it sank, it died’) are imitated
in the accompaniment so suggestively that one
might almost call it realism. On the words, ‘<em>und sterb
ich denn</em>’ (‘and though I die’) the music becomes
quicker with the growing emotion of the dying flower.
<em>So sterb ich doch durch sie!</em> continues the flower in ecstasy,
and on the beloved word, <em>sie</em>, the voice attains its
highest note and its emotional climax.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The last half of the eighteenth century in France gave
the world some of the loveliest songs of the age. The
types continued for a time to be those mentioned above,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>but the gain in grace and fluency over the preceding
century was enormous. <em>Opéra comique</em> was filled with
<em>romances</em> and <em>brunettes</em> and <em>bergerettes</em>. Not a few
songs, also, were composed independently. Among the
latter class we should mention those of Jean Jacques
Rousseau (1712-78), literary adventurer and musical
dilettante, who entwined himself so strangely into the
whole cultural life of France. Rousseau never had an
adequate musical education. He had served as tutor
in music in Switzerland and did not improve himself
much with his desultory self-education after he came
to Paris. But he was a true journalist, and no inadequacy
of preparation could daunt him. He had that
rare journalistic gift of knowing what people wanted
ten years before they themselves knew it. His <em>opéra
comique</em>, <em>Le devin du village</em> (1752), still occasionally
played, was the lightest of theatrical entertainments,
but continued in unabating popularity for sixty years.
Its success played no small part in setting or maintaining
the tone of <em>opéra comique</em> for the next half century.
Its songs were chiefly the romances which were popular
in Paris; they showed, perhaps, no great creative
ability, but were extraordinary, like all Rousseau’s
work, in catching a certain popular quality which escapes
analysis. The composer’s activity as essayist and
novelist, which places him as one of the greatest social
forces of modern times, prevented his ever doing much
work in music and the world is perhaps not much
the loser. But in his musical activity he was at least
important as a fashion-follower and a fashion-setter.
In 1781, after his death, there were published the hundred
romances and duets which he called <em>Les Consolations
des misères de ma vie</em>, containing some of his most
typical melodies. Among them is the famous romance
on three notes—<em>Que le jour</em>—which does not, indeed,
escape a sense of melodic poverty from its limited compass,
but reveals a delicate grace which makes it worth
remembering apart from its interest as an experiment.</p>

<p>But far greater than Rousseau in actual musical value
are, of course, the great French writers of <em>opéra comique</em>,
Monsigny (1729-1817), Philidor (1726-95), Dalayrac
(1753-1809), and Grétry (1741-1813). In technical
learning these men, especially Grétry, were all deficient.
But in a certain subtle melodic grace their <em>romances</em>
and <em>bergerettes</em> have never been surpassed the world
over. At first singing they may seem trivial or meaningless
or dry. They always lack that rich strain of
human genuineness which characterizes the German
Lied. Without doubt they are artificial, not spontaneous
in the more human meaning of the word. But if
they are artificial it is in the best sense. They represent
the most delicate conscious artistry, the nicest adjustment
of the means to the end, the more expertly for
being achieved with the simplest materials. The singer
needs a quite special faculty to understand them. The
joy of them is that of perfection in limited space, of
work well done. The singer must have a complete
command over detail, must be conscious of the relations
of each note he is singing. The beauty of these
songs is that of perfect good taste. They do not obtrude
themselves, they do not assume a higher value than
they possess, they do not seek undue praise. They are
restrained as a well-mannered hostess is restrained in
talking of politics or religion to her guests. It is not
that she is insincere, only that she feels it is not the
time for unrestrained sincerity. Like a true gentleman
of the world, these songs hate the too obvious. Like a
true aristocrat, they refrain from laying bare their
souls; they value themselves too highly to exhibit their
own virtues. They seek to be elegant and suave and
courteous. In short, they seek to be ‘good form.’</p>

<p>But a very different ideal from that of good form was
about to burst upon French national life. Rousseau’s
highly colored writings had carried with them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
germs of the great Revolution. A few of the best observers
were able to see that conditions could not stay
as they were, that human emotions, long inarticulate,
must soon spring to violent expression. The lovely
romance, <em>Plaisir d’amour</em> (1785), mingling with such
an innocent military song as <em>Malbrouk’s s’en va-t-en
guerre</em>, could show no hint of the completely changed
state of the public emotions five years later. In 1789
the storm broke. Europe realized that the people had
entered the institution of government. And soon, too,
in their crude way, the people had begun to enter the
institution of French musical art. A certain fiddler-beggar,
playing daily for <em>sous</em> on the <em>Pont Neuf</em>, one
Ladré by name, picked up a lively dance tune, heaven
knows where, which he played daily on his fiddle and
presently published under the name, <em>Carillon national</em>.
And some one, even more obscure to history, set
words to it, beginning with the immortal phrase which
Benjamin Franklin had repeated continually in France
in reference to the American Revolution—<em>Ça ira!</em> (‘It
is coming!’). These words shall not here be called
poetry. Yet they had certain of the supreme virtues
of poetry, namely, simplicity of language and utter sincerity
of statement. ‘<em>Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!</em>’ sang the
mob as it led its captives to their death. ‘<em>Les aristocrats
à la lanterne</em>’ (‘Hang the aristocrats!’). Such sentiments
were not exalted. Their statement was far from
delicate. Similar sentiments toward the peasants had
many a time been expressed with infinite grace and
good taste in the court of Louis XVI. But when the
mob had achieved the ability to think ‘Hang the aristocrats’
and to make a song of it and to sing that song
aloud on the streets a new force had entered into the
life of men. And, what is more to our purpose, a new
force had entered into the art of song. Never before
had emotion been expressed so directly or so violently.
The tune is something like our ‘Dixie,’ though without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
its joyousness. It is a fiddler’s tune, distinctly unsingable,
especially since it was ignorantly arranged so as
to lie in places far above the compass of the untrained
voice. But its spirit was that of flowing blood and clattering
iron. To this day <em>Ça ira</em> produces an effect of
emotional savageness which can hardly be duplicated
in all song literature.</p>

<p>And Paris presently gained, from some unknown
source, another tune, almost equally effective and with
words equally to the point. It was the <em>Carmagnole</em>,
with its grim refrain, <em>Vive le son du canon</em> (‘Long live
the sound of the cannon’). This was sung daily in what
is now the beautiful <em>Place de la Concorde</em>, where, during
the ‘Reign of Terror,’ scores of aristocrats and political
suspects were executed daily. The mob liked to
see the blood flow and, joining hands in a great circle,
would bellow this very singable tune and its sentiments
to the just Heavens. But this song was overshadowed
in popularity by another—the famous <em>Marseillaise</em>,
which has been called, perhaps justly, the greatest of
all songs. Rouget de Lisle, a military engineer and
dilettante musician, wrote the poem and the melody one
night in Strassburg, early in 1792, for the troops to sing
at the review the next day. He called it <em>Chant de
Guerre</em>. The song made its way to Marseilles and was
taken up by the body of Republican volunteers on their
forced march to Paris in July, 1792. It instantly spread
in the capital, being known as <em>le Chant des Marseillais</em>.
The Marseillians, with this song on their lips,
were among the foremost in the storming of the Tuileries
a few days later, when the king finally became
the helpless prisoner of the people. Thenceforth it
accompanied the Republican armies on their victorious
marches through Europe. It is part of the irony of
such things that de Lisle, who wrote the great Republican
song of the Revolution, was born a royalist and remained
one till his death. Patriotic songs, during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
revolutionary period, appeared in great abundance, but
the great majority of them, as always at such times,
were vapid and artistically insignificant. From among
them, however, have remained two or three of exceptional
quality. One is Gossec’s ‘Hymn to the Supreme
Being,’ designed as a religious song which an anti-ecclesiastical
government could use without inconsistency,
and Méhul’s noble <em>Chant du départ</em>, written
to be sung at the departure of the armies, and still so
used. This song, which was Napoleon’s favorite (he
forbade the <em>Marseillaise</em> as too violent), represented
the pure Republican element of the Revolution, as opposed
to the more violent communistic elements. In
its elevation of style, in its perfect fitness of words and
music, it remains one of the greatest patriotic hymns
of the world.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Leading up to and even post-dating Schubert’s time
we find two names which must enter into every history
of song. The first is that of Ludwig Spohr (1784-1859).
Spohr presents a peculiar problem. One of the
most eminent musicians of his day and a man known
before all else as an innovator, he has come to be the
merest dead wood of musical history, a part of the
gigantic tree, but a part which has become useless while
other parts are still flourishing. Spohr felt, as Beethoven
felt, that the old harmonic order had reached its
zenith and that the time was ripe for freer and more
daring expression. He was constantly straining to
achieve this, but he lacked sufficient genius and his
effort remains—only straining. He was always searching
for expressive nuance, but his stock of tricks was
limited and his emotional range slight. His many songs
have completely dropped out of sight. In them detail
is elaborated until one loses all sense of form and outline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>The other song writer who must be mentioned here
is, of course, Beethoven. Beethoven’s songs do not
often find a place in song recitals nowadays, but they
are an organic link in the great German hierarchy from
Heinrich Albert to Schubert. In addition to three songs
of finest inherent quality we must credit him with the
practical invention of the song cycle and the cultivation
of free form and expressive detail in a way that clearly
foreshadows Schubert. The three great songs mentioned
are: ‘The Glory of God,’<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> <em>In questa tomba</em>, and
the <em>Busslied</em>. The first is as noble a strain as anything
in the great symphonies, a finer product because a
simpler one than Schubert’s <em>Die Allmacht</em> in the same
spirit. The <em>Busslied</em> has a long, half declamatory introduction
following the words with faithful accuracy,
presently, as the lyric element becomes more marked,
settling into a measured song, over an impressive bass
which is instinct with religious dignity. The second,
<em>In questa tomba</em>, concentrates in a few lines of music
the grim seriousness of the words. <em>An die ferne Geliebte</em>
(‘To the Far-off Loved One’) is a true cycle, as
Schumann later understood the form. The songs are
connected by modulating intermezzos on the piano and
the last song is followed by a piano postlude which introduces
the melody of the first. The songs themselves
are not of first quality, but the form and intent of the
cycle are yet another proof of Beethoven’s astonishingly
progressive genius. This cycle seems to look forward
to Schumann rather than to Schubert. It uses, in fact
not a few of Schumann’s own tricks—especially the deceptive
cadence—to lend an ‘atmospheric’ quality to the
music, or to prevent too great a finality in a musical
phrase which accompanies an unfinished thought. The
piano part shows a conscious effort to make the separate
details expressive in their own right. Beethoven,
in this cycle, was emphatically writing in the new and
not in the old style. The singer should be familiar with
this remarkable group if he is to appreciate the later
work of Schumann. (The final song, <em>Nimm sie hin
denn, diese Lieder</em>, is well worth knowing for its own
sake.) Though Beethoven is not one of the great names
in song literature, these pieces show eloquently that
the great symphonist touched no form that he did not
enrich.</p>

<small>FRANZ SCHUBERT</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Art-song and the romantic spirit—Precursors of Schubert—Schubert’s
contribution to song; Schubert’s poets—Classification of Schubert’s songs—Faults
and virtues—The songs in detail; the cycles—Schubert’s contemporaries.</p>
</div>


<p>If the art-song begins with Franz Schubert there are
two reasons for it. The first is the comparatively accidental
one that Schubert was the greatest of lyric geniuses—the
song writer <em>par excellence</em>. The second is
that just as he arrived upon the scene the romantic element
in music began to gain the upper hand.</p>

<p>For modern song is nine-tenths a romantic product.
There might be such a thing as a classic art-song, but
its existence is hardly more than hypothetical. Almost
by definition the art-song is opposed to what we call
the ‘classic’ spirit in music. For the art-song, let us recall,
is, above all, a personal, detailed expression. It
is intimate, subjective, predominantly emotional. The
classic spirit (in music as well as in the other arts)
avoids the emotion that is too personal and too subjective
as something immodest—much as a young girl
would avoid telling the details of her love affairs to
strangers. The classic is always inclined to stress the
formal elements. But the very definition of the <em>durchkomponiertes
Lied</em> (which is almost synonymous with
the term ‘art-song’) is that it does not adhere to a common
form, being free to formulate itself according to
the requirements of the text.</p>

<p>It must be more than a coincidence, then, that Schubert,
the master song-writer, came at a time when music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
was bursting forth into romantic expression. Romantic
song could not have been born much earlier.
For music, as an instrument of emotional expression,
did not come to maturity much earlier. Emotion we do
find expressed in Haydn and Mozart certainly, but it is
subordinate, restrained, and not very precise. It rarely
seems to be the prime object of the music. The prime
object seems rather to be the giving of pleasure through
the beauty of musical patterns. The music must not
be obviously inappropriate to the words of an aria, but
it is not thought of as expressing their sense in itself.
The movements of a Mozart symphony may have for
us some mild emotional connotation; but in the composer’s
mind, in all probability, it was not the emotion
which germinated the music, but the music which
germinated the emotion. The music of the long period
before Schubert was predominantly formal. It became
increasingly complex and refined. It greatly enlarged
musical technique and the means of expression. From
the emotional point of view the eighteenth century was
<em>storing up</em> the technical materials which the nineteenth
was destined to <em>use up</em>.</p>

<p>It was Beethoven who developed the expressive
power of music to its grandest proportions. Never has
emotion been shown more powerful, beauty more dignified,
than in his symphonies. The art of music, as it
passed from his hands into those of younger men, was
a grand and universal instrument, equal to any emotional
demand men might want to make upon it. But,
if Beethoven had developed all these capacities in music,
he had by no means used them all. Emotion in his
music is that of the epic poet, broad and grand, rather
than that of the lyricist, personal and subtle. He had
developed his instrument to marvellous perfection.
He had played upon it only a few of its tunes. The
greatest of the classicists, he was the man who taught
the romanticists their trade. He indicated how music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
could be used primarily for emotional expression. But
the doing of it he necessarily left largely to those who
came after.</p>

<p>Among the first and the greatest of these was Schubert.
He was born to sing. He loved a beautiful melody
beyond anything else. In some ways he was like
a woman, responding with infinite tenderness and delicacy
to the impressions that came to him from without,
divining shades of feeling which a man can rarely
catch.</p>

<p>And, just when this man came, burning to write personal
and emotional songs, Beethoven had forged the
finished instrument for the purpose. By this time all
the conceptions of rhythm and design had been agreed
upon among musicians. The scales and the modes had
been adopted, the sense of the tonic deeply inculcated
in every hearer, the independence of all the keys had
been established and their relation agreed upon. All
the ordinary positions of chords had been tested, and
all the normal progressions agreed upon. Composers
had experimented with many forms and had worked
out the capacities of each. In short, men had come to
an almost complete agreement concerning the conventions
of musical technique. If this had not been so,
it would not yet have been time for romantic song. For,
just as a poem can have no precise meaning until all
matters of words and syntax have been agreed upon, so
music cannot become accurately expressive while people
are vague in their minds about the identity of this
or that chord. In the same way freedom of form could
have no meaning for people until the laws of form were
wholly understood. The subtleties of emotion could not
be expressed until people generally had begun to feel
in music the emotions to be subdivided.</p>

<p>The things that Schubert did with music in 1815 were
hardly dreamt of twenty years before. There were occasional
foreshadowings, nothing else. Mozart, always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
technically flawless, did not approach his full creative
maturity until toward his death, when he gave evidence
of becoming one of the greatest of innovators. And
it is Mozart, whose music Schubert knew well and admired
beyond measure, who chiefly foreshadowed romantic
song before Beethoven’s great period. In the
famous ‘Statue’ scenes of <em>Don Giovanni</em> Mozart seems
suddenly to have peeped into a whole new world of
music—the world of primary emotional expression.
The same sense of half-discovered expressive possibilities
we catch in some of his later symphonies. And
in his last opera, ‘The Magic Flute,’ there are songs preserving
the emotional richness of the best German folk-songs.
Such arias as <em>In diesen heil’gen Hallen</em> or <em>Isis
und Osiris</em> are the last word in song before Schubert
broke through the bonds of form and established the
<em>durchkomponiertes Lied</em>.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>But song proper before Schubert is largely in the
hands of men who by no means hold a primary place
in musical history. Of course, it can nowhere be said
to have a beginning. But we can sense the feeling for
romantic song as far back as the <em>Geistliche Lieder</em> of
Philipp Emanuel Bach, published in the middle of the
eighteenth century. The preface to these songs is a
remarkable document. Bach says that he has tried to
set fitting melodies to the words; that where the various
stanzas of a song were so different in spirit that a
single melody could not express both with equal faithfulness
he has tried to strike an average between all
the stanzas and to compose the tune which will be
most appropriate to all; that he considers it unjust
to the poem to compose a tune which is suitable only
to the first stanza, as is the usual practice; and, finally,
that he realizes that Gellert’s poems, being didactic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
are not of the sort best suited for musical settings, yet
the high earnestness of the poet’s work justifies musical
treatment.</p>

<p>These remarks foreshadow the romantic spirit in
more than one respect. First, Bach recognizes the importance
and integrity of the text: the music exists in
order to enhance the poem, not the poem in order to
sing the music. Next, Bach feels the power and the
obligation to express the spirit of the words in detail.
Further, he clearly feels the contradiction inherent in
the strophic form—making one tune do service for
various dissimilar stanzas. Finally, he feels that song
is at its best when it is emotional. In all this he is
entirely at one with the romantic song writers, from
Schubert on. In his criticism of the strophic form he
has put his finger on the central problem of the art-song.
It is true, his solution of the difficulty was different
from that of the romanticists, as was inevitable with
a composer who came half a century before the problem
was ripe. But he shows in his preface that he regards
his solution as no more than tentative.</p>

<p>The songs themselves are not remarkable. They are
much like the <em>Geistliche Lieder</em> of the composer’s great
father, except that a subtle and almost indefinable
change has come over them in the direction of the ‘intimate.’
They are short melodies, much like a German
chorale, except that they have a gentler, smoother
movement. The strophes are sometimes in one of the
recognized melodic forms and sometimes comparatively
free. When closely compared they reveal not
a little individuality (which is undoubtedly what the
composer was aiming at), but, taken as a whole, they
seem too much like short cantata arias to suggest expressive
song.</p>

<p>The real spirit of song was preserved in the German
<em>singspiele</em>. These were lively dramatic entertainments,
interspersed with songs, like the English ballad operas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
except that the music was usually composed especially
for the piece. The <em>singspiele</em> were not taken seriously
by the educated classes, hence the lightest kind of joyousness
reigned in them, and the music was that which
would appeal most quickly to the hearts of the people.
The tunes were, in fact, generally as much like true
folk-songs as their composers could make them. <em>Singspiele</em>
were written and performed by the hundreds
during the eighteenth century. Many of the more popular
songs were remembered and sung by the people as
half-naturalized folk-songs, and the successful composers
were usually fertile producers of songs independent
of the <em>singspiele</em>. This was the true song-tradition
of Germany before Schubert’s time. It grew
out of the art of the people and spoke familiarly to all.
It was a dignified and firmly established art institution,
though it was given hardly more recognition by
the great musicians of the time than the symphony
composers of to-day give to operetta. The <em>singspiel</em>
folk-song type, moreover, was the type which was called
into service for the setting of the works of the standard
poets of the time. Zelter’s settings of Goethe’s poems
were scarcely to be distinguished, in point of form,
from the songs that were sung in the cheap theatres.</p>

<p>Among the best of the <em>singspiel</em> composers was Johann
Adam Hiller (1728-1804), also distinguished as the
first director of the famous Gewandhaus concerts in
Leipzig and as perhaps the first writer of true <em>durchkomponierte
Lieder</em>. His songs kept the popular flavor,
but strove for vigorous expression of the text and, in doing
this, broke out of the simple strophe or stanza form.
The spirited character of Hiller’s <em>singspiele</em> is suggested
by the names of some of them—‘The Devil is
Loose,’ ‘The Hunt,’ and ‘The Village Barber.’ Johann
André (d. 1799), fertile composer of <em>singspiele</em>, has a
place alongside of Hiller as a pioneer in that he was
probably the first to adapt the <em>durchkomponiert</em> style<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
to the ballad, setting Bürger’s famous ‘Lenore’ soon
after it appeared in 1775. The true ballad style, however,
was more freely cultivated by Johann Rudolph
Zumsteeg (d. 1802), commonly known as the inventor
of the ballad form. He composed settings for several
poems to which Schubert and Löwe later set their
hands, notably Schiller’s ‘Ode to Joy,’ <em>Des Pfarrer’s
Tochter</em>, and <em>Ritter Toggenburg</em>. Johann Schulz, who
was another prolific <em>singspiel</em> writer, is chiefly famous
for his beautiful ‘Songs in the Folk-Manner,’ which appeared
between 1782 and 1790, when Herder’s pioneer
collection of <em>Volkslieder</em> (words only) had just commenced
to create an interest in the subject of popular
song.</p>

<p>But the most famous <em>singspiel</em> composer of the time,
and one of the most interesting personalities among the
lesser musicians, was Johann Friedrich Reichardt
(1752-1814). Unlike most musicians of the age, Reichardt
was a man of wide interests and excellent education.
At the age of twenty-three he became royal choirmaster
under Frederick the Great at Berlin. But he
was a radical by temperament and seems to have
caused the head that wore the crown to lie uneasy. His
visits to Paris gave him such a sympathy with the approaching
French revolution that he later lost his position
in Berlin on account of his radical politics. For
a time he was choirmaster at Cassel to Jerôme Bonaparte,
Napoleon’s brother, who was anxious to pose as
a patron of art. Reichardt caught the ‘folk-manner’ in
his <em>singspiele</em>, but he was not a naïve musician in the
technical sense of the word. His choruses and concerted
pieces sometimes show a grace and artistry
which suggests Mozart, and his songs are always organically
and artistically conceived. He set in the simple
strophe style some sixty of Goethe’s songs and Goethe’s
delightful <em>singspiel</em>, <em>Erwin und Elmire</em> (as did also
André). We must give Reichardt praise for working
in musicianly style, with a fresh vein of melody and a
graceful sense in the organizing of it. But we should
make a mistake if we gave him a very high place in the
history of the development of song, for Schubert’s
earliest efforts tower far above his and they surely owe
but little to them.</p>

<p>Schubert’s admiration for Zumsteeg and for his use
of the ballad form (to which we doubtless owe ‘The
Erl King’) was extended to another song writer of the
time, Karl Friedrich Zelter (1758-1832). This composer,
who did a notable service as director at the
Berlin <em>Singakademie</em>, was a personal friend of Goethe
and had an extensive correspondence with him, which
has been preserved and published. He set a great number
of Goethe’s songs in the simple and unpretentious
style of Reichardt. This much pleased the poet, who
was professedly not much of a musician. In fact, it
seems likely that Zelter frankly directed the great man’s
musical tastes. Zelter’s songs, some of which are still
sung by German singing societies, are spirited and musicianly.
In their manly and straightforward way they
compel one’s liking. If they do not figure as an element
in musical history it is because their simple form
offered little that was of service to the genius of Schubert.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>This genius was, along with that of Mozart, the most
spontaneous the world of music had ever seen. It
seemed to work by a sort of divination. Whereas Beethoven’s
musical ideas developed slowly and under great
mental pressure from themes of little value, Schubert’s
songs often came into his mind almost in an instant
complete from beginning to end. From the age of
thirteen (and probably earlier) he was continually
writing songs. Often he would compose as many as
three or four in a single morning, especially when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
was unusually pressed for money. Most of the time
he did but little revising. If the musical idea as it came
was not of fine quality, then it could go to the scrap-basket
or to anybody who cared for it; there were
plenty more good tunes where that came from. Schubert’s
supply of beautiful melodies was inexhaustible.
He never had to nurse and pet a tune in order to get
the maximum of musical service out of it. More than
any other song-writer Schubert ‘sings himself.’ And
his songs, for the most part, ‘wrote themselves.’ The
poet would pick up a book on a friend’s table and, discovering
therein some lovely poems, would be seized
by musical settings for them. Sometimes he wrote as
though in a trance. The music seemed to come from
some anterior source, and, passing through his brain
on its way to the paper, to make him intoxicated.
When he died at the age of thirty he left behind him
some eleven hundred musical works, of which more
than six hundred were songs of all descriptions. This
was the product of scarcely more than fifteen years of
activity. It is obvious there could not have been much
revision. But this is hardly evidence that Schubert
was incapable of self-criticism. He had his favorites
among his songs and doubtless realized that many were
as worthless as later generations have found them.
And he did, in certain cases, spend considerable effort
in revision; there exist, for instance, several different
versions of ‘The Erl King’ in Schubert’s handwriting.
But his lack of revision was a result of his overpowering
fertility rather than of carelessness. If he kept on
writing new songs he might strike a masterpiece any
time. Why waste his time polishing second-rate pieces?</p>

<p>Briefly stated, what Schubert did for song was to
establish it as one of the great departments of music.
We know what it was before his time—an unpretentious
amusement, considered appropriate chiefly for
the vaudeville theatres and the banquet tables of roistering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
students. Among the educated classes song was
loved, but hardly respected. The great composers
wrote songs only as bagatelles for their amusement or
for a special occasion. It was hardly realized that the
song form, so slight and so modest, could receive the
burden of great ideas and radical innovation.</p>

<p>Schubert, by force of genius, proved that the song
could be as great intensively as an opera or oratorio
could be extensively; that to write a perfect song was
as difficult and worthy a task for a great artist as to
write an oratorio. To prove this he showered all the
riches of his artistic equipment on the song. First of
all, he gave to it great melodies. The melodies of the
best art-songs before his time could not be compared
with the great melodies which musicians had put into
symphonies and operas. Musicians had felt that songs
were not worthy of their best melodies, but only of
their second and third best. Schubert gave to song
his very best.</p>

<p>Next, Schubert chose (among his many texts) some
of the greatest short poems in German literature. Musicians
previously had generally considered the words a
very unimportant part of vocal music. True, the music
of the eighteenth century (especially in Germany) is
full of exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions occur
as if by accident and prove that composers either didn’t
care or didn’t know which texts were better and
which were worse. It is true, also, that Reichardt Zelter,
and others set the poems of Goethe to music, but
their settings were unpretentious and hardly aspired
to be in themselves adequate to express Goethe’s
thoughts. With Schubert, for the first time, we find
the greatest poetry married to the greatest music. It
must be admitted, also, that Schubert’s taste was not
highly critical in the matter of poetry. Among his six
hundred songs are a great many with insipid or pompous
words. But some of these texts were written by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
Schubert’s personal friends (such as his room-mate
Mayrhofer) and were set as a personal compliment.
Further, Schubert, who worked daily, did not always
find the best of poems at hand, and was obliged to take
what he could get, though he probably knew which
were better and which were worse. And, finally, he
was generally best inspired by the best poems, which
should be a proof of his sensitiveness to poetic excellence.
At any rate, one finds the texts of Schubert’s
songs almost an anthology of the best German lyrical
poems written in the century before his death. And
with some of the verses is music that seems to have
been made by one and the same master artist to fit for
all time. On the whole, though Schubert was not a
man educated in <em>belles lettres</em>, he showed a vivid appreciation
of poetic excellence which has been a mark of
great song writers ever since.</p>

<p>Next, Schubert showed a marvellous sense of poetry
in music. The music before him had been, as we have
said, predominantly formal. With Beethoven it had
reached its most perfect formal development and with
the symphony and sonatas of Beethoven’s later years
broke through formal bonds in its search after more
intense expression. The violent conflict between form
and expression is the glory (and to some minds the
defect) of Beethoven’s later work. But Schubert in his
songs seems to feel nothing of this struggle. It is as
though he had been born on the other side; as though
Beethoven had done the fighting for him. Or it is as
though a mountain stream had struggled through rocks
and over a precipice to reach the quiet level of the
plains below. With Schubert we feel only joyous spontaneous
expression of the words. The expressive resources
of music which his forerunners had prepared
are laid at his feet, and from them he chooses with
wonderful acuteness the details and devices he needs.
This sense of poetry could hardly be found in the songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
of Reichardt and Zelter. Sung with the words their
music would doubtless seem appropriate. But played
without the words to point the meaning they would
seem pleasing but colorless. On the other hand,
if you play the songs of Schubert on the piano you
will get, to a surprising degree, the feelings conveyed
by the words. It is not too much to say that before
Schubert song music was appropriate only; with Schubert
song became <em>expressive</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, Schubert gave to the art-song that freedom
of form which has been a characteristic of it ever since.
Not that he was the first to write the <em>durchkomponierte</em>
song or any of the other freer forms, but he was the
first with the genius necessary to establish such forms
(or formlessness) for all time. Schubert’s predecessors
had not been pedants. Within their limited capacities
some of them had been genuine poets of sentiment.
But form had nevertheless retained its hold on the
spirit of their song writing. The regular recurrence of
measured lines, or the building up of the song according
to a scheme of regular repetitions or alterations,
had been to them a matter of second nature (except
when a Hiller or a Zumsteeg tentatively broke through
for experiment’s sake). Such a song as Schubert’s
<em>Aufenthalt</em> or the early ‘Gretchen at the Spinning
Wheel,’ in which there is no discoverable scheme yet
a most cogent unity, would have been hardly conceivable
to these early pioneers.</p>

<p>Schubert, then, with a marvellous fund of melody,
a sense of poetic values in words and music, and a
free instinct for expressive form, did for the song what
Haydn had done for the symphony—put it on the musical
map. He was able to do this not alone because
he was a great musician, but because there were great
poets in Germany whose lyrics he could set. Let us
see who and of what character these poets were.</p>

<p>The poets whom Schubert set to music (over 100 in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
all) represent several stages of a tremendous upheaval
in German life and literature—roughly, the period of
the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. For
convenience we may divide them into three classes—the
‘Storm and Stress’ poets, the Romantic poets, and
the ‘young-German’ poets. The <em>Sturm und Drang</em>, or
‘Storm and Stress,’ tendency was the German equivalent
of the pre-revolutionary upheaval among the educated
classes of France. Its ideal was that of the highest
perfection for the individual—personal rights rather
than social duties. The so-called Romantic movement
(in the narrower meaning of the term) was at its
height during Napoleon’s period of power. It was
double. On the one hand, it was <em>Sturm und Drang</em>,
individualism carried to its extreme, with a high premium
set on the imagination and a morbid interest in
what we should to-day call ‘psychology.’ On the other
hand, it was the growth of the social and national spirit
which aroused a sense of nationalism in Germany under
Napoleon’s tyranny and enabled the Germans gloriously
to shake off the French yoke. The third period,
in which Schubert did most of his actual work, was
that of disillusionment, when the liberal dreams of the
German enthusiasts had been met by the stupid reactionism
of the German princes and the Congress of
Vienna. The German uprising against Napoleon had
been synonymous in the minds of most with a movement
toward liberal institutions and political freedom.
Under the royal houses of Germany the people were
forced back, at the point of the sword, to a state little
better than mediævalism. The poets of the ‘young-German’
movement saw that the dreams of the previous
generation had been made a fiasco and turned
to cynicism, with just a shadow of a bitter dream of
vengeance stored up for the future.</p>

<p>The great poets of the <em>Sturm und Drang</em> movement
were, of course, Goethe and Schiller. Goethe, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
the most universal minds the world has ever known,
was able to enter into a situation or a human emotion
so intensely that he was an ideal lyric poet. His command
over the music of the German language was complete.
All Germany was dazzled by the wealth of color
and nuance which he found in life and reflected in his
poetry. Schiller was in every way his inferior. His
inflated rhetoric always stole the lyric quality from
his poems, which never pictured truth, either outer or
inner. But by the sheer energy of his spirit Schiller
was a man of the time. It is worth noting that though
Schubert set nearly fifty of his texts, not a single masterpiece
resulted. For there is in Schiller, properly
considered, little or nothing to inspire a genuinely lyric
poet. And, as is often the case in lyric poetry, the
minor men do some of the best work. Some of Schubert’s
best texts are supplied by Claudius, Schubart,
Stollberg, and Hölty, minor members of the fraternity
which stirred up all Germany to the expectation of a
profound revolution. These men were crying out
against the vices of the aristocracy, or praising the simple
life of the peasants, as Herder had taught them.
Their songs were a glorification of the individual, proclaiming
the intensity and beauty of his spontaneous
feelings—ideal lyric material.</p>

<p>The era of the Napoleonic wars brought a new generation
of poets to Germany. It was the period when
the vision of great deeds was stirring every one to
demonstrate his own power. This side of the movement,
represented in Schubert’s songs by the brothers
Schlegel, was decidedly morbid. But there was another
side. For Napoleonic oppression had aroused a new
sense of dignity and national solidarity in German
hearts, and there arose a group of poets to sing of it.
Most typical is Körner, author of the famous sword
song, who volunteered for the army, saying to his
father: ‘Germany is rising; my art sighs for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
fatherland’—and died in battle. This adoption by art
of a new fatherland was signalized by a new return of
poetry to all that was popular and traditional in German
life and history. It is to this inspiration that we
owe poems by Uhland and Müller, which Schubert set
to music.</p>

<p>The third era was that of disillusionment, when Platen
could write</p>

<p class="indent5 p1 p1b">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">‘... man kann hienieden</span><br>
Nichts Schlech’res als ein Deutscher sein.’</p>

<p>The lyric poetry of the time became either a cynical
grasping of selfish interests, as often in Heine, or a renunciation
of the outer word, a peace which is to be
found in contemplation and humble love, as in Rückert.</p>

<p>In translation, also, Schubert was familiar with the
work of certain foreign poets, notably Shakespeare and
Walter Scott. To the inspiration of the former we owe
at least two masterpieces, ‘Who Is Sylvia?’ and ‘Hark,
Hark, the Lark!’ From the latter we have the wonderful
‘Ave Maria.’ We should not forget, also, the songs
of Ossian, now almost forgotten. These were forgeries
(in all probability) by a Scotch schoolmaster, purporting
to be translations from the Gaelic of the songs of
the minstrel Ossian, who had been no more than a tradition
for centuries. The literary world took them in
earnest, and such men as Goethe became enthusiastic
over their wild and rugged imagery. But to us they
seem rhetorical and far removed from the simplicity
of genuine folk-poetry. And Schubert seems to have
felt this, for, though he set eight of the long Ossian
songs, not one of his settings is memorable. Again
the absence of the true lyric spark had left him cold.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Among Schubert’s songs we find an extraordinarily
wide range of form and subject-matter—so wide that
all song writers since his time have not been able much
to enlarge it. We have said that he was the first to
apply musical genius to the <em>durchkomponiertes Lied</em>.
But he was not a specialist in this form. He seems to
have had no especial preferences, but to have been
guided by the nature of his poem. A number of his
songs are in the strophe form—simply contrasting
phrases of the music forming the tune, which is repeated
without change for each stanza of the words,
as in the simple folk-tune type. Of this class are some
of Schubert’s best songs, such as ‘The Heather Rose,’
‘The Fisher,’ ‘Praise of Tears,’ ‘Wandering,’ ‘The
Brook’s Lullaby,’ ‘Hark, Hark, the Lark!’<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and many
others.</p>

<p>Next we find what we might call the ‘developed
strophe’ form, in which the simple stanza organization
is preserved in spirit, but some change enters into
the make-up of the whole song in accordance with the
demands of the text. Examples of this are the famous
<em>Du bist die Ruh</em>, in which the final strophe is much
altered to express the intenser feelings of the poet; or
the <em>Gute Nacht</em>, from the <em>Winterreise</em> series, in which
the melody of one stanza is sung in the major to convey
the contrasting effect of calmness; or the ‘Serenade,’ in
which the repeated strophe is followed by a free coda
necessary to give completeness to the idea. In the
class of the ‘developed strophe’ form we might group
such pieces as ‘Her Portrait,’ which repeats the main
strophe after a contrasting middle section. Or there
are such songs as ‘By the Sea,’[1] which are almost in
the strict strophe form, but varied here and there in
some minor detail, proving that however much Schubert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
felt the beauty of form he did not feel its dogma.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the quite free or <em>durchkomponierte</em>
form. The examples of this are innumerable in
Schubert’s works: we recall easily the famous <em>Aufenthalt</em>
(‘Abode’) and <em>Doppelgänger</em> (‘The Double’),<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> <em>Der
Wanderer</em>, and <em>Das Wirtshaus</em>. In these songs there is
every variation from a deceptive strophic form to the
utmost dissimilarity, and yet there remains always a
<em>sense</em> of unity which is the work of a master.</p>

<p>Besides the pure lyrics Schubert wrote ballads and
scenas. The former are simply stories told in verse.
Unlike the lyric, the ballad is highly objective, seeing
the characters as things apart and as acting for themselves;
yet like the lyric it is highly sympathetic with
emotions, and sometimes identifies itself alternately
with one character and another as completely as though
it were a lyric. This is because of the dramatic quality
implicit in every story,—a quality which is particularly
attractive to the primitive imagination. The
ballad, in short, is a miniature drama, in which the
characters speak in their own words with each other,
and in which rapid and vigorous action is abundant.
Examples of this form in Schubert’s songs are Schiller’s
‘The Diver,’ and of course ‘The Erl King.’</p>

<p>We should also distinguish a third class of songs—the
<em>scena</em>. This is a combination of the lyric and the
ballad; it is essentially an emotional utterance, but it
usually pictures the characters and the scene, and often
involves some sort of dramatic action. The Ossian
Songs partake of the nature of the <em>scena</em>, but the best
example is Schiller’s <em>Erwartung</em>, in which the singer
is waiting for his sweetheart to come to him, and is
beguiled by various noises of the night into thinking it
is she.</p>

<p>The scenas and the ballads involve not a little of
the declamatory style, which is quite unlyrical. Declamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
in song is familiar to us in the recitatives of
the older operas, but declamation in the true sense is
more melodious than dry recitative. It is, in fact,
genuine melody, with all elements of melodic beauty,
except that it is independent of strict measure and
rhythm, receiving all its accents from the words which
it follows with greatest nicety. The possibilities of
this style of music have only begun to be developed in
the last two or three decades. In Schubert declamation
is usually on the right track, but is pretty likely
to be uninteresting. We must make an exception, however,
of such masterly bits of declamation as the last
line of ‘The Erl King,’ in which the half-spoken announcement,
‘Lo, in his arms the child was dead,’ closes
the ballad abruptly and seems to frame it off from the
workaday world; or the last line of ‘The Wanderer,’
in which Schubert’s poetic sense reinforced the emphatic
word with an emphatic melodic note: <em>Dort,
wo du nicht bist, dort ist das Glück</em>. But on the whole
we must admit that the whole body of Schubert’s
declamatory and dramatic songs is hardly worth the
trouble of study, except for the purpose of enlarging
one’s knowledge of the composer. If it were not for
the wonderful ‘Erl King,’ greatest of ballads, people
would doubtless be saying that Schubert was a lyric
song-writer only, and had no feeling for the ballad form.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Of Schubert’s six hundred songs, as we have said,
many are of little or no musical value. Sometimes
the melody seems too facile; it expresses nothing; it
is like every other ordinary tune. And sometimes,
especially in the longer ballads and scenas, there is a
lack of any musical character; commonplace chords
and scraps of indifferent melody succeed each other to
fatigue. The length is sometimes enormous. ‘The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
Diver’ occupies nearly forty printed pages, and many
others between fifteen and twenty.</p>

<p>It is more regrettable that some of the songs should
be sad mixtures of greatness and triviality. ‘Death-Music’
is such a song. The opening bars have a deep
solemnity, which is almost equal to the dignity of the
theme, but seems just a little too thin or facile. Then
on the words <em>Hebe aus dem ird’schen Ringen</em> comes
a passage which is one of Schubert’s great moments,
and this is repeated in finer development on the words:
<em>Alles grosses werd’ ich sehen</em>, until one can almost
feel one’s self carried into the mysteries of death. But
then follow three pages of melody which are irritating,
for they have much beauty and expressiveness, but
seem aimless and disorganized. In ‘Viola,’ which is
a matter of twenty-one pages, there are one or two of
the most gracious melodies Schubert ever wrote, but
the song as a whole, what with length and formlessness,
is hopeless. <em>Fülle der Liebe</em>, again, is both beautiful
and expressive, altogether a distinguished piece
of work, except that its movement soon becomes so
monotonous that it is unendurable.</p>

<p>So Schubert is often betraying the rapidity with
which he worked. But he has left us at least one hundred
songs which are immortal. First of all, they are
worth knowing for their wonderful stock of melodies,
as pure and rich as any composer in the world has
ever given us. The enchantment can hardly wear off
with such melodies as those of ‘Praise of Tears,’ ‘The
Trout,’ <em>Du bist die Ruh</em>, ‘The Linden Tree,’ ‘The Inn,’
‘To Sylvia,’ ‘Litany,’ and ‘The Serenade.’</p>

<p>It is by no means the melody of the drawing-room.
The dainty, snobbish grace of the French <em>bergerette</em>
is foreign to Schubert. He seems anxious to sing with
everybody. It is recorded that one of his favorite pastimes
was walking out with a friend on a Sunday afternoon
to one of the villages in the neighborhood of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
Vienna, and watching the peasants dance and hearing
them sing their songs. This popular sense persists in
all Schubert’s music, however delicate may be his
delineation of mood. He had nothing of the aristocrat
in him. The son of a schoolmaster, accustomed to poverty,
and accustomed to teach in an almost menial
capacity in the house of Count Esterhazy, he acquired
none of the tastes of the aristocrat and was content
to take his pleasures as other people did. Besides, the
whole tradition of German music has been remarkably
close to the people. Even Mozart, the most polished
of composers, wrote in ‘The Magic Flute’ music that
would have delighted any peasant. So we are not surprised
to find in Schubert’s lyrics a strain of folk-song,
especially in the cadences and progressions which
the Germans love so well. Take, for instance, the
continually recurring cadence of the song <em>Sei mir
gegrüsst</em>, or that of ‘Praise of Tears.’ It sets the spirit
for the whole of the song. And it is taken from the
very bone and sinew of German music. Or take the
short middle section of ‘The Wanderer,’—in which the
Wanderer cries out, ‘Where art thou, Where art thou,
My beloved land!’—or the first of the Erl King’s songs
in the ballad ‘The Erl King’; or the whole strophic
tune of ‘The Fisher.’ Hum these over two or three
times. Then take at random two or three German
folk-songs—<em>Ach du lieber Augustin</em> and <em>Immer langsam
voran</em>, or what not, and hum these. And then two
or three French <em>bergerettes</em>. The relationship of Schubert
will then be quite clear. These matters of musical
analogy are subtle and slippery. They cannot be established
by analysis. But they can always be proved
or disproved by the sympathetic ear.</p>

<p>But Schubert was writing art-songs, not folk-songs.
Accordingly he was obliged to give more precise meanings
to his melodies than folk-songs choose to give.
He must not sing only of love or sorrow, but of a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
mood of love or sorrow. This is what we mean by
the refinement of melody. Not that the unrefined
melody is less worthy or less beautiful, only that it
is less precise. In refining his tunes Schubert’s delicate
artistic sense stood him in glorious stead. The
<em>Ave Maria</em> is first of all a beautiful German melody.
But it is also a delicate, sensitive melody, which might
have been sung by the essentially aristocratic Ellen.
Or notice the delicacy of mood implied in Heine’s poem
<em>Ihr Bild</em>. It is essentially a civilized mood, one which
comes over a person inside of a house with the lights
turned low, a mood which a folk-song would never be
called upon to express. Schubert catches it in a few
simple notes. He does not strain his melody in order
to make it express an unusual mood. He selects his
notes—that is, refines the melody—until its expression
has become specific and accurate instead of broad and
general.</p>

<p>This matter of melodic refinement (which must be
divined by a sort of sixth sense) leads us to one of the
essential characteristics of Schubert’s songs (and of
art-songs in general)—namely, detailed expression.
Here we can be more specific. Compared to later song-writers,
Schubert makes very little effort to emphasize
details in his texts. He is never willing in his lyrical
pieces to distort or disturb the flow of the melody or
the design of the whole, in order to illustrate a detail.
But a slight study of his songs will show that he is
never overlooking these details. And when it seems
to him proper to give them precise expression, the device
is always at his finger-tips. Take one of the loveliest
of all his songs, <em>Das Wirthshaus</em>—‘The Inn’—from
the cycle <em>Winterreise</em>. The whole song should
be played through first to get the mood of weariness,
of spiritual hunger and thirst, that pervades it. Then
on the words <em>die müden Wandrer</em>—‘tired wanderers,’
comes this progression:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p class="center ebhide p2b"><a href="images/score1-p207.png">[PNG]</a>[<a href="music/score1-p207.mp3">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>Notice the wonderful D flat of the accompaniment.
And notice too with what magic the simple chords of
the next measure seem to fit the word <em>kühle Wirtshaus</em>,—the
‘cool tavern.’ A little later, on the words:
<em>bin matt zum Niedersinken</em>—‘tired to exhaustion’—is
the following passage:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe30" id="score2-p207">
  <img class="w100 p1" src="images/score2-p207.jpg" alt="ilo2p207" title="p207ilo2">

<p class="center">bin matt zum Niedersinken und tötlich schwer verletzt</p>

<p class="center ebhide p2b"><a href="images/score2-p207.png">[PNG]</a>[<a href="music/score2-p207.mp3">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>Notice the G flat of the accompaniment, how it creeps
into the harmonic framework and gives poignancy to
the expression. And then four measures further on,
on the words: <em>doch weisest du mich ab?</em>—‘and do you
turn me away?’—there is this very simple musical passage:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe18" id="score3-p207">
  <img class="w100 p1" src="images/score3-p207.jpg" alt="ilo3p207" title="p207ilo3">
</figure>

<p class="center">Doch weisest du mich ab</p>

<p class="center ebhide p2b"><a href="images/score3-p207.png">[PNG]</a>[<a href="music/score3-p207.mp3">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>Only one altered chord, that containing the B natural,
but what pathos lies in it!</p>

<p>An even finer instance of musical delineation is the
song <em>Der Doppelgänger</em>, the last but one that Schubert
ever wrote. Mr. Henderson, in his ‘Songs and Song
Writers,’ justly says that this wonderful song anticipates
Wagner’s theories and methods. Here we have
the continuous melody, the leit-motif (the first four
measures of the accompaniment), the declamatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
voice part, and the ‘orchestral comment’ which we associate
with the Wagnerian music-dramas. We cannot
fail to notice in this song the ghostly effect of the thick
chords kept in the bass section of the pianoforte’s range,
nor the uncanny effect of the short, almost gasping,
phrases for the voice, nor the fierce picturing of terror
on the words <em>meine eigne Gestalt</em>. What couldn’t
Schubert have been in the history of music, asks Mr.
Henderson, if he had lived!</p>

<p>Schubert’s command over modulation is facile and
abundant. Sometimes there is no rest in the matter
of modulation. Yet the changes of key and mode never
seem strange. Tonalities melt into one another, and
voices lead as naturally as they do in the simple key-schemes
of Haydn. The best of examples is the wonderful
song, <em>Die Allmacht</em>. Nominally in the key of
C major, it remains actually in this key for only about
a fifth of its length. The astonishing simplicity and
inevitableness of Schubert’s modulations are well exemplified
by the change from F major to G flat major on
the words <em>Gross ist Jehovah der Herr</em> (at their next to
last appearance). Wagner used precisely this modulation
about ten years later for the climax to the great
prayer in the opera <em>Rienzi</em>. But we find it no uncommon
thing to discover that strokes of genius in other
composers have been anticipated in Schubert.</p>

<p>But the richness and smoothness of Schubert’s modulations,
which are everywhere to be discovered in his
songs, are not the most important qualities from the
artistic standpoint. The important thing is the marvellous
deftness with which the composer uses his
modulation for expressive purposes. Let us return to
<em>Das Wirtshaus</em>, a thorough knowledge of which is a
liberal education in Schubert’s art. Modulation here is
like flowing water. But notice especially the last (repeated)
line of the poem: <em>Nun weiter denn, nun weiter,
mein treuer Wanderstab</em>—‘then on again, my faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
wanderer’s staff.’ The first half of the line is in C
minor. Then on the words <em>mein treuer Wanderstab</em>
it goes again into its original F major. The effect is
past all analysis. We feel the tragic vista of life ahead
of the man, the eternal trudging along white dusty
roads. The human pathos of the modulation is intense.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice, in passing, that Schubert
gets his most tragic and pathetic effects out of the major
mode rather than out of the minor. Besides the
example just quoted one recalls the entrance of the
major in <em>Ihr Bild</em>,—an effort of most delicate pathos;
and the ending of ‘Death and the Maiden,’ in which
the coming of the minor brings with it the feeling of
deep human tragedy as contrasted with the somewhat
spooky tragedy of the preceding minor. Schubert’s
effects, though usually very simple, rarely come from
a reliance on conventional means.</p>

<p>Another of Schubert’s expressive devices is famous.
It is the dissonance of D flat against D against C (or
a corresponding combination), recurring in ‘The Erl
King’ when the boy shrieks in terror at the sight of
the evil ghost. It was strenuously objected to by certain
ones who heard it in Schubert’s time, and it is
recorded that one of the objectors withdrew his criticism
because the compound dissonance resolved so
smoothly. The justification, if justification is needed,
is something other than this. It is that the device is
tremendously expressive.</p>

<p>In ‘The Erl King’ we cannot fail to notice how the
triplet motive in the accompaniment binds the song
closely together. In nearly every case Schubert finds
some means of accomplishing this end, when the free
form of the song might threaten to distract one’s attention.
In a number of the <em>Müllerlieder</em>, in which the
brook figures constantly, the rippling water is suggested
(not imitated) in the accompaniment. The devices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
by which the suggestion is accomplished seem
naïve to us to-day, but it is perhaps more artistic than
an attempt at imitation would be.</p>

<p>Suggestive devices are innumerable. Note the movement
of the breeze in ‘Suleika’s Second Song’; the opening
chords, suggestive of deepening night over the sea,
in <em>Am Meer</em>; the delicate will-o’-the-wisp figure in
<em>Irrlicht</em>; the bass figure that suggests huge weight in
<em>Atlas</em>; the leaping triplet figure in ‘The Trout’; the
tragic snatches of melody in the bass of <em>Aufenthalt</em>,
and so on without limit. It must be remembered that
such details as these were much more of a novelty in
Schubert’s time than now. A century ago the use of
music for detailed expression was comparatively
strange.</p>

<p>We should bear in mind, also, how slightly this attention
to detail in Schubert affects the external unity
of the song. Schubert’s method (except in the long
declamatory pieces) was essentially lyrical. He wanted
to write a piece of music which, while truly expressive
of the words, would be a beautiful piece of music
even without them. He kept the organization and proportion
of his music, as such, always in view. The
whole course of song after him illustrates the conflict
(which was the origin of the art-song in the first place)
between this formal design and accuracy of expression.
A simple strophic song can, as we know, be
quite perfect in design. But only rarely can it also be
quite accurate in the expression of the words. The
musical realist will seek to make the music detailed
and expressive at all costs. The many to whom beauty
comes first, on the other hand, will admit the realistic
detail only when it accords with the beauty of the
pattern. It is instructive to note how Schubert solves
the problem. While he was never a formalist in the
stricter sense of the word, his sense of pattern beauty
was such as would be pained at a realistic detail that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
was detrimental to form. Judged by modern standards
he was conservative in his procedure. But considering
his conservatism he managed to get a wonderful
amount of detailed expression into his songs. No
song-writer has ever had a more delicate and accurate
feeling for these details of human realism.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Schubert’s genius will never be known to people who
imagine they know it from the half dozen hackneyed
songs that are most famous—the ‘Serenade,’ ‘Hark,
Hark the Lark!’ ‘Who Is Sylvia?’ and one or two others.
There is a little group of Schubert songs which are
rarely heard and almost forgotten, which are of great
beauty, such as the <em>Wiegenlied</em>, <em>An die Sonne</em>,
<em>Gretchen’s Gebet</em>, and <em>Clärchen’s Lied</em>. And there are
scores of others, which are known in a vague way,
but not well known to many a singer. No singer
should attempt to sing one of Schubert’s songs in public
without being familiar with most of these other
lyrics.</p>

<p>Schubert reveals the folk genius in being able to
achieve the highest beauty within the smallest compass.
Such a snatch of melody as the first line of the
‘Litany’ is a work of pure genius. They say that the
test of a picture is its ability to be ‘lived with.’ The
same is true of a melody. The first line of the ‘Litany,’
as well as the whole of it, can be sung each day and
never lose its charm. It has all the suave grace of a
tune out of Italian opera. It might become cloying and
sentimental. But it does not. It remains dignified and
sincere. It reveals ever new beauties and adorable
traits of character which could not be suspected at
first glance. This kind of genius is beyond the analytical
powers of the musical theorist to explain. The
greatness of large forms—for instance, a symphony
by Beethoven—can in part be explained, just as a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
correct symphony can be written by a man without
talent. But to write greatly within half a dozen bars—this
is a miracle. Only the folk-composer and the
highest conscious genius can achieve it.</p>

<p>We see the same genius in the final measures of
‘Death and the Maiden.’ The Maiden sees Death approaching,
and begs him to pass by. He replies that
he has not come to cause her pain. He is a friend and
will give her peace and joy. And the music, a succession
of the simplest chords, glides gradually into a
major that seems to wring the tears by main force from
the eyes. Every now and then Schubert introduces unexpectedly
such a musical phrase, which seems to concentrate
into half a dozen notes all the sincerity of
the German genius. We find it in the ‘Second Harper’s
Song’ of the Mignon series, on the words: <em>Ihr lässt
den Armen schuldig werden</em>:</p>

<p>Of the songs that ‘sing themselves,’ Schubert has
written many. We must mention ‘The Fisher,’ which is
unusual in song literature as being a true ballad in
strophe form; the ‘Heather Rose,’ which retains the
quality of Goethe’s words in that it must be intimately
known to be appreciated; <em>Wohin</em>, from the <em>Müllerlieder</em>,
in which the tune seems to flow as inevitably as
the brook which is the motive of it; ‘The Trout,’ the
melody of which Schubert used as the theme of the
last movement of his famous string quartet; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
‘Lullaby,’ mentioned above. The flowing quality of
these songs is due to the fact that they are closely in
accord with the felt traditions of German music, containing
a maximum of the usual and a minimum of the
unusual, while remaining unique and creative as a
whole. In other words, they have an abundance of the
expected and nothing of the commonplace. And this
is why it is of such extreme value for every musician
to be familiar with a quantity of songs. Simple songs
which are great in their human appeal have concentrated
within themselves all that people throughout
the centuries have agreed upon as beautiful. They
contain in the simplest form the elements of all great
complex music. The singer who can appreciate and
love the simple song is not likely to go astray in singing
the works of Strauss and Reger.</p>

<p>But Schubert’s particular historic claim to greatness
is his introduction of precise musical expression into
the Song. This takes all forms—a variety as broad as
his wonderful genius. In ‘Sea Calm’ it is a succession
of quiet and slow chords, which preserve the evenness
of the calm sea without its monotony. In ‘The Wanderer,’
it is a succession of slightly different emotions,
each lyrically expressed, culminating in the impressive
recitative. First the Wanderer announces that he has
come from the mountains, ever searching for something.
Then the lovely melody which Schubert later
used in one of his quartets—the motive of unsatisfied
wandering. Then, with a change of sentiment, comes
the cause of the unrest—‘Where art thou, My Native
Land?’—a mere snatch of rich song. Then a quick
movement as the Wanderer sees in his mind’s eye the
fresh greenness of his native hills. Then the moody
wanderer’s motive once more. And finally the two
lines of recitative—with all the beauty of poetry and
all the force of prose—‘There, where thou art not, there
is happiness.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>‘The Young Nun,’ though it has perhaps been overrated,
shows a powerful dramatic expression of the
singer’s feeling as interpreted by surrounding nature
(a favorite device of the Romantic poets). The song
rises into religious exaltation, with the thunderstorm
outside, as the nun returns resignedly to the praise of
her religious contemplation. <em>Die Allmacht</em> is a song
in the most exalted style of Beethoven, but executed
with a technique which is utterly of the romantic
school. God is praised by all his works, by the storm
no less than by the devout heart in prayer. Each is
expressed by Schubert in a musical passage of great
beauty. Yet each section is but an inextricable part
of the symphonic movement—for religious adoration
is not a collection of separate feelings, but a great
emotional synthesis. The music for Goethe’s wonderful
‘Wanderer’s Evensong’ is no less remarkable for
the musical blending of shades of emotion. But it is
something more, something which is in the highest degree
typical of the art-song. For it follows the words,
not only in expression but in accent, so that not a syllable
is falsified. No recitative could be more just to
the spoken value of the words. In fact, this song can
be read as a pure recitative, in which the words, spoken
sincerely and unaffectedly, correspond exactly with the
music. And yet, looked at from the other side, it is a
perfect melody. This blending of the declamatory and
lyrical elements in a perfect synthesis is true to the
spirit of the art-song. For no art-song is good that does
any sort of violence to the text, as it would be spoken.
And yet no art-song is a song if it has not a musical
beauty of its own. And it is one of the highest tests
of the trained singer to give full value to both these
elements, without letting either crowd out the other.
‘Gretchen’s Prayer’ is another fine example of this, less
simple but no less perfect. Here, as the supplication
rises into emotional entreaty, the music becomes more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
independently lyrical, floating in air as though to bear
the petition to a higher sphere.</p>

<p>Schubert is the great exemplar of a form which has
been cultivated by almost every composer since his
time—the song-cycle. He was not the originator of
the form, for Beethoven (in addition to others) had
written a true song-cycle in <em>An die Ferne Geliebte</em>.
But Schubert was the first to show the full possibilities
of the song-cycle.</p>

<p>He has left us three such works—the <em>Müllerlieder</em>,
of twenty songs; the <em>Winterreise</em>, of twenty-four; and
the <em>Schwanengesang</em>, of fourteen. The last was not
planned by the composer as a cycle, but was issued as
such by his publisher just after his death, when (as
has so often been the case) the Germans had waked up
partially to the genius they had lost. And for once
the commercial publisher was justified. For the songs
were actually Schubert’s swansong, being written in
the last few weeks of his life (the final one of the series
was the very last of his compositions). Moreover, they
are of a pessimistic character which is rarely betrayed
in Schubert’s earlier works.</p>

<p>The <em>Müllerlieder</em>, or ‘Miller’s Songs,’ were composed
by Schubert in his first enthusiasm over Wilhelm
Müller’s poems. It is related that he went to call upon
a friend one evening, found the friend out but discovered
the book lying upon his table, became immersed
in it while waiting, and finally walked away with it in
his pocket. The next day he apologized for the borrowing,
pleading that the poems had inspired some
beautiful melodies, and he felt he had to write the music
for them all. The friend forgave him, as have all
who have since learned to know the songs he wrote to
those words.</p>

<p>The Miller Songs tell a connected story, after the
manner of Tennyson’s ‘Maud,’ by making each one of
the poems the lyrical expression of the hero in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
successive moods. The hero of Müller’s cycle is a typical
figure of the German romanticism. He is a wanderer
on the face of the earth, a sensitive, introspective
man, a friend of sorrow and in love with unhappiness.
To us he seems a rather ridiculous figure. But he was
taken seriously enough by the Germans of the time,
who had good cause to be pessimistic over the disorganized
state of their country and their national life.
This miller hero is suffering from unrequited love,
which was a favorite theme of the romanticists. But,
above all, in the spirit of the time, he is a lover of nature.
He sees in nature a reflection of his own moods
and sorrows. Nature seems to us to be one of the
staples of lyric poems—worn to the bone. But, as a
matter of fact, nature is a rather recent invention of
civilized man’s. The Alps were ‘discovered’ by the
poets no earlier than the eighteenth century. Certain
early poems, notably the Iliad, show a feeling for natural
beauty. But the study of nature as a cult, the conscious
effort to find moods and meanings in her, is
hardly more than a century and a half old. Folk poetry
contains very little of it, and then usually only in sentimental
connotations. In Schubert’s time nature was
still a recent discovery and a thrilling one. So Schubert’s
contemporaries, apart from their pessimism, were
able to immerse themselves in such poetry as that of
the <em>Müllerlieder</em> and the <em>Winterreise</em> without feeling
the strained preciosity which we inevitably feel in it
in our realistic age. As they stood and in their time
the <em>Müllerlieder</em> were admirably suited to romantic
musical treatment by Schubert.</p>

<p>In the first song, ‘Wandering,’ the hero is happy
enough in his simple melodic tramping about the countryside.
Knowing Schubert’s own predilections in that
direction, we feel that he must have put some of his
own enthusiasm into the song. In the second song of
the series, ‘Whither?’ he meets a rippling brook, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
filled with romantic wonderings and presentiments
concerning its destination. Can we doubt that it leads
him to his future beloved? He follows it and comes
upon a lovely mill, whose wheel is propelled by the
brook, simple, of beneficent and sympathetic nature.
The wanderer applies to the miller for work and is
taken on. Thereupon, in a beautiful song, he pays his
thanks—to the brook. In the fifth song, <em>Feierabend</em>,
he has become as one of the miller’s family. He loves,
like a true apprentice out of Wagner’s <em>Meistersinger</em>,
to hear the master, at the close of a day’s work, say
‘Well done!’ But most of all he is happy because he
has met the miller’s daughter.</p>

<p>In the sixth song, ‘Curiosity,’ he is in perplexity, and
turns, as every romantic youth of the time did, to nature
for help. ‘Does she love me?’ he is persistently asking,
and he addresses his question to the brook. In
the next song, ‘Impatience,’ his attraction for the girl
has become a full-fledged passion. ‘<em>Dein ist mein
Herz!</em>’ he cries ecstatically. In ‘Morning Greeting’ he
addresses some pretty stanzas and compliments to the
miller’s daughter. The tenth song is an excellent example,
in simple form, of the delicate mood which, as
we have said, it is the special province of the art-song
to express. The young miller and the girl are sitting
together—beside the brook, of course. She gets up
and goes into the house, and the tears come to his
eyes. In the next song the miller’s daughter has accepted
and returned his love, and in the following one
he is at joyful peace with nature, and is praising the
green ribbon which his loved one wears.</p>

<p>But then enters the tragic complication. For we
hear a hunter’s horn, and the handsome young hunter
descends upon the peaceful mill. The miller previsages
the meaning of this. In the fifteenth song he is struggling
between pride and jealousy. Then he is once
more praising the dear color—green, which his sweetheart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
loves because it is like the fresh green of nature.
And in the next song he is cursing the hateful color
(the same green) because its wearer is no longer true
to him. In the eighteenth song the miller’s daughter
has given her love to the huntsman, and the young
miller has lost hope. The dead flowers (for fall has
come) express the state of his heart. These flowers
must lie upon his grave. But—when the loved one
passes by the grave let the flowers burst once more
into fresh bloom. In the nineteenth song the miller
holds a conversation with his beloved brook, which
suggests to him the sweet suicide which was ultra-fashionable
in all romantic literature of the time. And
in the beautiful last song of the cycle the brook sings
to sleep the dead man by its side.</p>

<p>The poems are all truly lyrical, and invite musical
setting. They rise to no marked poetic heights, but
are thoroughly poetic and emotional in feeling. Though
Schubert did not achieve a uniform standard of excellence
throughout the series, the general average is high.
The first song, ‘Wandering,’ has a memorable melody
of a simple sort, and the second, which we have mentioned
above, is one of his masterpieces. ‘Impatience,’
though formal and strophic in structure, has an unrestrained
sweep of feeling which is rare in Schubert
and looks forward to the later romanticists of music.
The ‘Morning Greeting’ is a simple Italianate melody of
great beauty, one which is likely to lead astray the
singer who tries to give it overmuch ‘expression.’ ‘The
Hunter’ is spirited, but has no great musical value.
‘Jealousy and Pride,’ though not very attractive musically,
is interesting as an example of Schubert’s discriminating
use of the simplest kind of accompaniment
for precise emotional expression. <em>Die liebe Farbe</em>,
however, is one of the masterpieces. It is almost
French in its thread-like delicacy, but this will prove a
pitfall for the singer who has not attained full control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
of the niceties of vocal expression. The formal daintiness
of the song is like the allegretto of some toy
symphony. And at the same time it is neatly expressive
of the playful mood of the words. The contrast
of the companion song, <em>Die böse Farbe</em>, of course offers
a problem to the interpretive singer.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most masterful song of the cycle is
the eighteenth, ‘Dead Flowers.’ This, in moderate two-four
time, is strikingly like the allegretto movement
of Schubert’s C major symphony, one of the loveliest
of all his orchestral pieces. The entrancing modulation
from an undecided minor to a spirited major on
the words ‘<em>Der Mai ist gekommen, der Winter ist aus</em>,’
is a touch which any lover of Schubert would recognize
as his unmistakably at the first hearing. But don’t
miss the finer art of this lovely passage, for the joyousness
of the major is deceptive; the miller is black
at heart over his failure in love, and is only beguiling
himself in a passing moment. Notice, therefore, the
plaintiveness of the accompaniment on this passage.</p>

<p>‘The Miller and the Brook’ is an interesting example
of the half lyrical, half declamatory style which Schubert
sometimes adopts, as we have seen. But the last
piece of the cycle is pure song. It is hard to analyze
the plaintive character of this melody, and hard especially
to understand how the augmented fourth, traditionally
considered a harsh interval, becomes at Schubert’s
hands an instrument of deep emotional expression.</p>

<p>It has often been pointed out that the motive of the
brook gives a subtle unity to this song cycle, and that
the motive is preserved in Schubert’s music. From the
rippling triplets of the accompaniment of ‘Whither,’
the first song in which the brook enters, to the cradling
motion of the accompaniment to the last, the brook is
almost continuously in the piano part. But, though
Schubert’s feeling here is extremely delicate, his technical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
means are of the simplest. If it is realism, it is
realism of the most primitive sort. We should not be
misled by the praise of the ‘brook music’ in this cycle.
True descriptive music, whether for good or for bad,
did not enter song until after Schubert. And we should
further remember that, although Schubert was indeed
the first great composer of the song-cycle, he never gave
the form the unity and inner meaning which was imparted
to it by Schumann, and which is typical of it
to our minds.</p>

<p>The <em>Müllerlieder</em> reveal admirably the tender interpretation
of sentiment of which Schubert was such a
master. But they are by no means songs of a greatness
equal to that of his next cycle, the <em>Winterreise</em>.
The ‘winter journey’ taken by the hero (Müller again
is the poet) is a pilgrimage in search of forgetfulness
after an unhappy love affair. Even more than the
<em>Müllerlieder</em>, it is an essay in the interpretation of nature
in terms of human sentiments. The songs, indeed,
are little more than a series of parallels drawn between
the scene of the winter landscape and the feelings of
the hero. They are a personalizing of the weather, a
dramatization of the thermometer.</p>

<p>In the first song the hero tells of his lost sweetheart,
and sings to the memory of her a touching ‘Good-night’
lullaby. The second hears the wind playing
about the roof of the house, and suggests that even so
circumstances play with man’s heart. In the third he
finds the cold air freezing his tears—thus his very sorrow
has become fixed and rigid. The fourth is a vision
of the world paralyzed in the cold of winter: his heart
is frozen and her picture is blotted out of it. In the
fifth he remembers the linden tree under which they
spent their happiest hours.</p>

<p>So the songs go, one after another. The ninth is the
‘Will-o’-the-wisp’ song; he will not be misled by these
false lights, for his heart has been misled by such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
beacons before. In the next, ‘Rest,’ the hero tells how
he is so occupied by the pain of his travelling and the
pain of his sorrow that only when he lays his body
down to rest at night does he realize how tired he is.
From this point on the great songs of the cycle are
numerous. The thirteenth, ‘The Post,’ pictures the
galloping of the approaching mail coach, with the
blowing of its horn. Is there a letter for him? No, for
he is alone in the wide world. The post departs—in
a minor key. In the fourteenth song, <em>Der greise Kopf</em>,
he notices that the frost has made his hair white, and
he thinks of himself as an old man, and wishes he could
be many years removed from his sorrow. In the long
and somewhat descriptive song, <em>Im Dorfe</em>, he enters a
village and the dogs bark at the lonely wanderer;
even so the world is strange and hostile to him. In
<em>Täuschung</em> (‘Illusion’) he sees a light in the distance,
and hopes it comes from a hospitable farmhouse. But,
alas! the light was an illusion, like the rest of the things
we hope for in life.</p>

<p>Then come five final songs—every one a masterpiece
of the first order. The <em>Wegweiser</em> tells of the sign-post
the hero sees on the road. But there is another
sign-post which is also directing him on his longer
road and it points relentlessly the way to Death. Yet,
in the next song, <em>Das Wirtshaus</em>, when he approaches
a graveyard, he finds no welcome awaiting: the rooms
of this tavern are all occupied. Death itself will not
soothe his loneliness. In the next song, ‘Courage,’ he
makes a final despairing effort to free himself from his
misery by pure force of will-power. If the snow flies
in his face, he will dash it aside. He will laugh loud
and merrily. If life is an illusion, he will <em>make</em> it
worth while. If there are no gods on earth, we ourselves
shall be gods. But this mood cannot last. He
sees two false suns in the heavens, in addition to the
one that has always been there. But they vanish, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the two suns of earlier years—the eyes of his beloved.
Only one more sun need vanish and blessed night will
come for him.</p>

<p>We are spared the suicide which we might expect
in the final song of the cycle. The wanderer comes
upon an old man playing the grind-organ. He grinds
out what music he can, but his little money-box remains
ever empty. The wanderer feels the brotherhood
between himself and the old man. ‘Play my
songs on your grind-organ,’ he asks. People have suggested
that this bit of verse must have come very close
to Schubert’s heart; for he, too, had made what music
he could, he too was alone in the world, and he too
found his little money-box always empty.</p>

<p>Of the songs of this cycle at least a third rank with
Schubert’s best. ‘The Lindentree,’ with its simple
strophic melody, is almost a folk-song among the German
people. <em>Die Post</em> is justly admired because of
the way it blends a mild realism with high melodic
and interpretative beauty. <em>Der greise Kopf</em> is especially
interesting as pointing forward to the more complex
and delineative style of several of Schubert’s
later songs, with its melodic peculiarity of outline and
the extreme importance given the accompaniment. In
superficial texture it much resembles <em>Die Stadt</em> (‘The
Town’) from his last song group.</p>

<p>‘The Signpost’ however, is more truly representative
of Schubert’s genius. The movement of the song is
symphonic, much like that of the ‘Dead Flowers’ in
the <em>Müllerlieder</em>. Its steady pulse of rhythm avoids
monotony by the most delicate of harmonic movement
in the inner parts. As the tragedy deepens toward the
end of the song the steady beat of the melody continues
for whole measures on a single tone. And in
half notes a bass and an alto voice move chromatically
toward each other through the best part of an octave.
The device would be a trick in the hands of a lesser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
genius; with Schubert it becomes poetic interpretation.
This wonderful song is abundantly worth careful
study; in particular, the harmonic freedom, combined
with liquid smoothness of voice progression, reveals
the romantic strain in the composer’s equipment and
something of his peculiar contribution to the development
of music’s expressive resources.</p>

<p>Of ‘The Inn’ we have already spoken. The deep
and tragic sweetness of it grows on one, impressive
as it is at first hearing. This particular mood of tragic
sweetness is a pitfall for composers. With any but
the genius it is sure to become maudlin. With Schubert
it became heartrending.</p>

<p>Such a song as ‘Courage’ cannot be overpraised. The
compressed energy of its movement is not that of animal
life, but of moral effort. Human will-power is felt
throughout it. The change from minor to major (Schubert
to the bone) in the last lines makes the hearer’s
blood surge to dizziness. It is one of the most difficult
songs to sing. For its energy may so easily be taken
for animal spirits. It is just the song to ‘run away’
with the singer. And when once the singer has lost
mental control of it, it becomes pitiless toward him.
The tonic arpeggio of the last line requires ultimate
exactness of vocal control. And from beginning to end
the least inaccuracy of intonation or accent will be
evident to the audience like a black streak on a white
shirt-front.</p>

<p><em>Nebensonnen</em> (‘Satellites’) is of utmost simplicity. It
is so unassuming that for a moment it seems all but
trivial. Yet this is the tender modesty of great lyric
expression. The song is a test of the singer’s taste.
The least over-sentimentalization of it will make the
judicious grieve. A thousand times better to make it
too simple and too prosaic than too emotional.</p>

<p>The last song, ‘The Organ Grinder,’ is written over
a monotonous ‘drone bass,’ imitative of a primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
grind-organ. The melody is apparently as crude as
the instrument that is supposed to have played it. But
somewhere in it one hears—one knows not how—the
deep strain of pathos which is one of Schubert’s miracles.</p>

<p>The third cycle, ‘Swan Songs,’ is matter for amazement
to every student of Schubert. For its composer,
in the space of fifteen years since he first began writing
in earnest, seems to have become a totally new man
with a totally new musical technique. It is traditionally
hard for a musician to change his technique once
it is firmly ingrown. The greatest musicians only—Beethoven,
Wagner, and a few others—have been able
to do it. That Schubert could do it—in addition to
the fact that he was thus willing further to endanger
his chances of material success—proves the marvellous
richness of his natural endowment. When one considers
that these songs were written by a man who
had just passed his thirtieth year one is ‘teased out of
thought’ with the curiosity as to what he would have
become in music had he lived. Some have answered—‘the
greatest composer of all time.’ The speculation
is fascinating, and it makes us love our Schubert the
better.</p>

<p>The fourteen ‘Swan Songs’ are written to seven
texts by Rellstab, one by J. G. Seydl, and six by Heine.
The last fact makes us pause. Rarely has there been
so rich a lyric poet as Heine, probably never one who
could so inspire song writers. His first book of lyrics
had been published only shortly before Schubert’s
death, and the composer had set six of them before his
final illness. Of these six, five are enduring masterpieces.
If only Schubert’s genius could have been
mated to Heine’s through the succeeding ten years!</p>

<p>The seven Rellstab songs include the universally
known ‘Serenade,’ the beauty of which is too obvious
and too familiar to need further comment. Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
and greater song of the list is <em>Aufenthalt</em>. The
speaker’s ‘abode’ is among the rugged cliffs, and he
reflects that his sorrow is as unshakable as the eternal
rocks. The furious sweep of the song’s movement is
breathless. Beneath and above the triplets of the accompaniment
is always a passionate and despairing
melody. When the voice rests for a moment the piano,
in marvellous imitation, takes up the strain. The climax,
on the words ‘<em>starrender Fels</em>,’ is terrific. The
final half-declaimed phrase is almost Greek in its
severe nobility.</p>

<p>Of the Heine songs the best known is <em>Am Meer</em> (‘By
the Sea’). The introductory chords scored in the bass
express the impenetrable mystery of the sea. The very
simple melody is the essence of moody retrospection.
Such a work as this is as supreme among songs as the
second movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony is in
orchestral music. <em>Die Stadt</em> and <em>Der Atlas</em> show the
great importance which Schubert accorded to the accompaniment
and the freedom with which he had come
to handle it. In <em>Ihr Bild</em> (‘Her Picture’) we have another
of Schubert’s very simple melodies—and how
impressive in its simplicity! Perhaps Heine was never
more perfectly set to music than in this instance.</p>

<p>The wonderful <em>Doppelgänger</em>, unique among Schubert’s
works, has already been mentioned. Mr. Henderson
is right in his judgment of this piece. It is
Wagnerism before Wagner’s time. It is the technique
of the latter half of the nineteenth century previsaged
by the genius of a poor and shy school-teacher living
in a cheap Vienna lodging. It is a vision and a
prophecy.</p>

<p>Of the ballads we need say little. Strangely enough
not one of them is of the finest quality, or truly representative
of Schubert, except that one which was the
first of his songs to be published, and one of the half
dozen to be most widely known—the ‘Erl King.’ It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
strange, and disappointing, when we consider the perfection
of this early attempt, that Schubert left the ballad,
one of the most attractive of song forms, to his
contemporary, Löwe, a man who had not a tenth part
of his talent. ‘The King of Thule’ is one of the best of
the remainder, but it is immensely surpassed by Liszt’s
setting. The ‘Fisher Boy’ is charming, but being in the
strophic form, is no contribution to the development
of the form. ‘The Young Nun,’ fine as it is, is too rhetorical
to satisfy a true lover of Schubert. In his more
declamatory style Schubert often fails even to be interesting.
‘The Singer,’ to words by Goethe, is workmanly
declamation such as any man of talent might
have written. The Ossian songs, of which ‘Kolma’s
Complaint’ is the best, reflect the somewhat strained
verbosity of the words, and fail to convince with their
beauty. The same is true of Schubert’s setting to
Klopstock’s scena, ‘Hermann and Thusnelda.’ Pomp
and circumstance drown out the music. For the true
Schubert we must leave the larger forms and return
to the shorter lyrics, which reveal the composer’s
highest glory—the greatest beauty in the simplest terms.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The writing of songs during Schubert’s time, and
immediately before, was carried on on an amazing
scale. It is not unusual to find composers of the time
writing thousands of them. These songs have practically
vanished from modern song-programs. But
many of them were extremely popular at the time, and
remain staples in the repertories of singing societies.
Not a few of them have become folk-songs second to
none in popularity. The simple form of most of these
little lyrics almost precludes their having any importance
in the history of song development, but it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
be a pity if they were lost altogether to the student
of singing.</p>

<p>The age in which they were written was, as we have
seen, the great age of German national feeling. The
intense sincerity and manliness of a Körner or an Arndt
filled the whole nation with generous sentiments, contrasting
with the delicate refinement of the French
culture on the one hand, and the morbid introspection
of the German romanticists on the other. Patriotic
and military songs abounded. It was also the age
of the formation of the male singing-societies which
have since become such a typical feature of German
life, and composers wrote freely for the four-part
male chorus, or for the male solo voice. It was also
the age of the awakening interest in folk-literature, and
German history or legend furnished many a tale for
men to sing around the festive board, or for nurses
to sing to the children at night. Finally, it was the
age of republican sentiment in Germany, the age
when an idealistic and naïve nation was still expecting
the reigning house to give constitutional government
once the people had freed themselves from French
rule. It was a Germany very different from the Germany
we have seen since the Franco-Prussian war—a
Germany that was less practical, less commercial,
less ambitious, but infinitely more simple and lyric.
Hence the output of fine songs was enormous. Never
was the German genius more spontaneous; never was
it more truly German. The songs of the time, which
repose by the thousands in old <em>Kommersbücher</em>, and
have sifted by scores into modern song collections, are
the very breath of fresh air and generous spirits.</p>

<p>At the period of Schubert’s early activity Weber was
the great national composer of the Germans. We have
seen elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> how German national sentiment centred
around his music when the German kings turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>traitor and sought to force the people back into an
age of eighteenth-century reactionism. His opera,
<em>Der Freischütz</em>, was a sort of Marseillaise in time of
exile for the lovers of German liberty and union. But
earlier than this Weber had made himself the chief
national musical figure in Germany. His settings of
Körner’s fiery <em>Leyer und Schwert</em> songs had raised him
from a hardworking kapellmeister into a household
name. The newly formed singing societies took up
the songs, and at least one, the ‘Sword Song,’ has lived
to this day. But in addition to these purely national
and military songs, Weber wrote a great number of
others, all in simple form and in the direct folk-spirit
which he mastered as no other composer mastered it
before or since. Many of them are sung still. But the
great majority have by this time become quite outdated.
We need only refer to one—the charming lullaby
<em>Schlaf, Herzenssöhnchen, mein Liebling bist du</em>.</p>

<p>Three composers preëminently continued Weber’s
work as composer of German opera—Conradin Kreutzer
(1780-1849), Albert Lortzing (1801-1851), and
Heinrich Marschner (1795-1861). Of these, Kreutzer
was peculiarly close to the German popular genius.
His settings of Uhland’s <em>Wanderlieder</em> are very fine,
<em>In die Ferne</em> being particularly worthy of study. Kreutzer,
too, was one of the most successful composers of
male choruses; his elaborate chorale, <em>Das ist der Tag
des Herrn</em>, will probably be remembered as long as
German music exists. Lortzing and Marschner freely
introduced simple strophic songs into their operas, and
by these are chiefly known. Their style was as simple
as Weber’s and the historical development of song
at their hands (slight in any case) is in a different
direction from that which Schubert took. Their melodies
are not inappropriate, but we look in vain in them
for any of the close emotional interpretation which we
find so abundantly in Schubert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>But the finest songs of this semi-popular style
(<em>volkstümliche Lieder</em>) were written by men who have
no other claim to greatness. We may mention F. H.
Himmel (1765-1814), Methfessel (1785-1869), Nägeli
(1773-1836), Lindpainter (1791-1861), and Silcher
(1789-1860). These are the true writers of modern German
folk-songs. The energy of their music is of an
elementary sort which the more highly trained composer
rarely equals. They live to-day in every gathering
of German students, in every Männerchor, in every
nursery. Ten people are familiar with their songs to
one who knows who the composers were. But the
gifts these composers have left to their people are co-extensive
with German culture.</p>

<p>Methfessel is direct and virile, the singer of battles
and of the manly virtues of the great ancestors. How
compelling is the vigor of ‘<em>Stimmt an, mit hellem Klang</em>’!
And what a boiling of the blood is in his fiery setting
of Arndt’s ‘The God Who Made the Iron Grow!’ Nägeli
is softer and more sentimental. We remember him
chiefly by <em>Freut euch des Lebens</em> and the charming
‘Good-Night.’ Lindpainter was less talented, and his
songs, which partook of a romantic nature, have almost
disappeared. But Himmel is among the greatest.
His setting of Körner’s ‘Prayer on the Eve of Battle’
(vastly superior to Schubert’s) is one of the deepest
expressions of religious faith in all song literature.
His ‘Ballad of the Three Tailors,’ from <em>Des Knaben
Wunderhorn</em>, is a delightful example of the typical
Studentenlied. And one should not overlook his four
songs from <em>Alexis und Ida</em>, in which he shows a delicacy
of sentiment approaching that of Schubert though
he wrote them some years before the composition of
the ‘Erl King.’</p>

<p>Finally, there is Silcher, who is to Germany exactly
what Stephen Foster is to America. His songs are
innumerable, and the number of great folk-songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
among them is astonishing. The very heart of German
music pulses in Silcher. The famous ‘Loreley’
melody is his, and also <em>Zu Strassburg auf der Schanz</em>
and the wonderful <em>Lebewohl</em>. He is one of the three
or four composers in the world who could with any
considerable frequency equal the beauty and directness
of folk-songs. He is a text for this chapter. Only
the student who knows and loves Silcher can truly
know and love Schubert.</p>

<small>ROBERT SCHUMANN</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Romantic music and romantic poetry—Schumann as a song-writer—The
earlier songs—The ‘Woman’s Life’ cycle; the ‘Poet’s Love’ cycle; the later
songs—Schumann’s contemporaries.</p>
</div>


<p>Schubert died just before the great artistic outburst
which we know as the romantic period. We have seen
elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> how this force grew and achieved expression
in Paris, and thanks partly to political conditions
spread to all parts of Europe. Schumann, though not
at all interested in politics, felt this force in its artistic
aspect, as did all other sensitive men of the time. After
Schubert, he was the one man preëminently to express
the new feeling in terms of song.</p>

<p>Much had happened between 1828, when Schubert
died, and 1840, when Schumann wrote his first songs.
To put the case briefly, the romantic movement in
music had got under way. People had begun to know
Schubert’s songs and the later symphonies of Beethoven.
The pianoforte had grown to perfection and
had come to have a technique and literature of its
own. The technique of harmony and polyphony had
undergone (partly at Schumann’s own hands) striking
changes in the direction of freedom and expressiveness.
The short piece in free form had become a recognized
part of musical literature. The national
movement in Germany, with its extensive use of the
folk-song, had been universally accepted. The travelling
virtuoso had become a fixed part of musical life,
and the musical centre of gravity had shifted from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>the nobles to the masses. In short, people had come
to look for intimate emotional expression in music,
and music had developed the means of supplying the
demand.</p>

<p>Since Schubert’s time, the text of a song had become
a factor of growing importance. Musicians began to
recognize that it should be regarded as equal in value
to the music. And along with this recognition arose
a remarkable group of poets, as we have seen in the
last chapter—a group which have supplied German
poetry with one of its most brilliant periods. This
group we have described as representing the period
of disillusionment following the shattering of the
dreams of German unity. For a time the hopes of the
people had been directed toward the political and social
field; what the best literature had expressed was
the feelings and aspirations which were common to
men. Now that all the fair dreams had been shattered
by the selfishness of the courts and the bickerings
of politicians, men asked, ‘What is the use?’ Turning
inward to examine their own souls, they produced
a delicate lyric poetry which contained just what the
art-song of the time needed—the intimate and personal.
No grand emotions ring in this period. In the
whole list of Schumann’s songs there is hardly one
whose words could be put into the mouth of a hero.
By far the greater portion are pessimistic. What the
poet remembers is a beguiling hour in the shade of
a tree. What he looks forward to is a smile from his
sweetheart. Every man tries to snatch his own small
portion of happiness from this life—and generally
makes a poor job of it. Nevertheless, a man usually
tells more of the truth about himself when he is discouraged
than when he is self-satisfied. And in the
lyric poetry of the time we get charming and truthful
analyses of human emotions and moods. The literary
standard is perhaps higher than at any previous period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
(excepting, of course, the work of the giants like Goethe
and Schiller). Versification is smoother, form is more
pleasing, and words are used with more regard for
their suggestive connotations. In short, men are looking
at details in this romantic poetry, even as in romantic
music.</p>

<p>High above all poets of the time stood Heine. No
German poet, except possibly Goethe, ever produced
such a quantity of short poems which have become the
property of every German child. The whole literature
of lyric poetry can show only three or four men who
can equal him in brief and direct expression. It was
Heine who brought German literature down from the
mountain tops and made it inhabit the homes of men.
His poetry was no ‘mighty line,’ with inverted phrasings
and high astounding polysyllables. He never spoke
the speech of the gods, as did Schiller. He had no
use for the paraphernalia of Greek mythology that
had been popular in the <em>Sturm und Drang</em> period. He
spoke a German that easily fits into men’s mouths as
they converse with their neighbors. Out of this he
fashioned poetry. His syntax is as simple as that of
the King James Bible (a rare thing in German literature).
Each statement is a unit. And so with each of
his thoughts and observations. Each comes to us in
its simplest terms. Heine’s vocabulary (in his poems)
is that of a child. His thoughts are those of any callow
love-sick youth. His statement is so literal that
it seems always to be on the verge of foolishness. He
even seems careless in literary art; his lines are uneven,
his rhymes the simplest imaginable, his rhythm disordered.
Yet beneath and beyond this simplicity is the
art of a careful workman, and the charm of a sensitive
observer of men. Heine’s poems have the true lyric
quality in that their real charm can never be finally
analyzed. We can only say that beneath those childlike
statements of the obvious was the genius of a poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>Heine’s genius, like that of Rückert, Platen, Chamisso,
Kerner, Eichendorff, and other contemporaries
mentioned in the preceding chapter, always tended a
bit toward the morbid. These poets partook of the
common malady of over-individualism. ‘It is not good
for man to be alone.’ The commonest and truest of
truths is that man is a social animal. It is impossible
for him to conduct his life except in company with
others. The stories of hermits who have gone mad with
loneliness have an excellent foundation in fact. And
just as man seems meant to act socially, so he seems
obliged to feel socially. It is a spiritual necessity to
think a good deal of others. ‘Whoso saveth his soul
shall lose it.’ The man who seeks to discover all the
treasures within him usually ends by finding nothing
there. And when it is the literary fashion (as it was
in Schumann’s time) to look exclusively within one’s
own soul, the age ends in helplessness with a moan of
despair. This condition is implicit in the poetry of
Heine. It is, as we have said, never the poetry of a
hero. It can console us in our leisure; it can never inspire
us in our labor. Yet the fault is not so serious as
it may sound. Few people have contracted serious
spiritual diseases from Heine’s poetry. The very simplicity
and brevity of it prevent the reader from taking
it too seriously. Read before the fire in the still hours
of the evening Heine cannot harm the tenderest soul of
a child of twelve. He was too genuine a humanist, as
well as too excellent a literary man, to be utterly removed
from health. He is a far more harmless amusement
than Byron, for instance, just as he was a far
greater poet than Byron. He was, of course, taken
much more seriously in his day than we can take him
in ours. Schumann in particular shows that he regarded
his poet as a text for the highest tragedy and
passion of which he as musician was capable. Yet
even in his own time Heine’s influence must have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
essentially healthy. For he had in abundance two qualities
that always tend to keep men in the path of health,
simplicity and humor. The mind that can think simply
is not wholly diseased. And we need never fear the
pessimist who can laugh at his own despair.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Two things preëminently Schumann brought to his
songs beyond what any composer had brought previously.
First there was an accurate regard for the text.
It is not to belittle Schubert to say that he did not show
Schumann’s accurate regard for the words. Schubert’s
regard for the text was conscientious and faithful; his
melodies are marvellously faithful to the spirit and
his musical prosody never does violence to the metre
and accent. But Schubert was working under a somewhat
different tradition from Schumann. He is more
the melodist, pure and simple. His attitude toward
musical prosody was somewhat negative; he demanded
of his melody only that it should not do violence to
the metre; beyond that it could follow its own musical
course. Hence, we not infrequently in his songs have
such passages as this, from <em>Die Allmacht</em>:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe18" id="score-p235">
  <img class="w100 p1" src="images/score-p235.jpg" alt="ilop235" title="p235ilo">
</figure>

<p class="center">verkünden seine Macht</p>

<p class="center ebhide p2b"><a href="images/score-p235.png">[PNG]</a>[<a href="music/score-p235.mp3">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>This, of course, is in no way reprehensible or violent to
the canons of art. But it differs from Schumann’s
method in that it puts a higher value on pure song—on
the mere joyous exercise of the vocal organs. Schumann’s
attitude toward musical prosody was more
positive; he demanded of his melody not only that it
should do no obvious violence to the metre, but that
it should take pains accurately to fit the minor accents
and quantities. He tried to make the text as sung not
very different from the text as declaimed. True, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
sometimes wrote mere lyric passages of melody on an
open vowel, like that in the above example from Schubert.
But such passages in Schumann are far more
rare. And the whole body of his songs shows that he
took the text more as his collaborator in matters of detail.
His songs are not valuable primarily because of
their melody. He has written many lovely melodies,
but a large proportion of his songs would be of comparatively
little musical value (at least in the voice
part) without the words. And his melodic invention,
taking his songs as a whole, is far below the exalted
work of Schubert. Besides, Schubert’s texts, though
not generally chosen without discrimination, do not
show the same careful selection as those of Schumann.
The poems of the latter are carefully selected for the
purpose of specific musical treatment, and in consequence
seem to have a higher literary value, whether
they have or not. Finally, Schumann had the immense
advantage of possessing nearly all of Heine’s wonderful
lyrics to choose from, a fact that in many an instance
gave him the opportunity of writing immortal music
‘married to immortal verse.’</p>

<p>The second all-important factor which Schumann,
over and above Schubert, brought to his song-writing
was a matured harmonic and pianistic technique for
the accompaniments. However truly Schubert divined
the possibilities of the modern pianoforte, just nearing
perfection in his day, he never wrote thoroughly in the
new style. His chords in the bass were apt to be
heavy and thick, his accompaniment is not spread
as widely as it might advantageously be, and his inner
voices never show the free and sprightly polyphony
which is peculiarly adapted to the piano. Had he
lived he would doubtless have become one of the greatest
masters of the new pianoforte style. But it was
left for Schumann consciously and reverently to take
up the work. Schumann did not write a single song, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
publication at least, until he had been working for
full ten years for the piano. His first enthusiasm was
for the piano. The shattering of his hopes to become
a virtuoso forced him to turn his enthusiasm toward
piano composition. And in his early years of creative
activity he developed the possibilities of the new instrument
with all the enthusiasm of his youthful nature.
His first twenty-three works, written between the years
1830 and 1840, were almost exclusively for the piano.
In them he developed a pianoforte idiom which was
unique in its day. With this new and mature technique
he approached his song writing. Inevitably he looked
as lovingly toward the accompaniment as toward the
voice part—some critics say even more so. He had
learned how to make the most of the mechanical peculiarity
of the piano—its <em>struck</em> strings which are incapable
of a true sustained legato; he treated the piano,
in other words, essentially as a hammer instrument
and not as a wind instrument, like the organ. He developed
a surprising adeptness at enharmonic modulation,
for which the complete piano keyboard is so peculiarly
adapted. He learned the full use of the
damper pedal—not so much for sustaining chords as
for permitting a wide separation of notes. He learned
how to make his inner voices pianistic instead of vocal,
making them depend wholly on their contour and position
(as opposed to tone quality) for their independence.
Finally, he had learned how to give each composition
a style of its own—a peculiarity of pianistic
manner over and above its individuality of musical
content. All these qualities of Schumann’s piano technique
should be kept in mind in studying his accompaniments.
They represent a good half of the musical
value of Schumann’s songs. If the vocal parts of the
<em>Dichterliebe</em> cycle had never been written the accompaniments
would still have a high value as proof of
Schumann’s mastery over pianistic writing. Without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
an appreciation of the pianistic side of Schumann’s
vocal work no singer can begin to appreciate the songs;
he cannot even satisfactorily sing his part of them.
A large share of Schubert’s accompaniments can be
played satisfactorily by a pianist of slight ability, if
only he have the knack of following the singer. But
scarcely any of Schumann’s accompaniments can be
played satisfactorily except by a performer who is an
artist at his instrument.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Schumann’s songs can be easily divided into two
groups. The first, comprising about a hundred, was
composed in 1840, the year of the composer’s marriage,
and of his most fertile and romantic productivity.
After writing these, he professed himself satisfied with
what he had done (well he might be) and doubted
whether he should ever write songs again. His most
fervent admirers cannot help wishing that he had kept
to his purpose. A dozen or so indifferent songs were
produced in the next ten years, and then, from 1850 to
1852, when his mental powers had begun seriously to
fail, he turned out more than a hundred. The contrast
between the two groups is striking. The first is nearly
all genius; the second nearly all mediocrity. At best,
two or three songs from this whole later period are
worth knowing. Of the first group there is scarcely
one which does not show high creative excellence and
there are at least fifty of the finest quality or close to it.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of the songs of the earlier
period are grouped in cycles. Of these, however, there
is only one which contains that most distinctive quality
of the cycle, a unified narrative—as in Schubert’s
<em>Müllerlieder</em>. This is the immortal <em>Frauenliebe und
Leben</em>. Another, the <em>Dichterliebe</em>, is closely bound together
and primarily intended to be sung as a unit.</p>

</div>

<p>Three more cycles, while looser than the one just mentioned,
are like it in being set solely to the words of
one author. And another, <em>Myrthen</em>, has little beyond
a common title for unification. A few other songs have
no grouping except that of an opus number.</p>

<p>The first of the songs form a <em>Liederkreis</em> (song-cycle),
opus 24, words selected from Heine. This is
obviously an experimental work, though it contains
several fine numbers. <em>Ich wandelte unter den Bäumen</em>
delicately maintains its mood. Number 5, <em>Schöne
Wiege meiner Leiden</em>, is pure melody with a simple accompaniment
in Schubert’s style, one of the most affecting
of all Schumann’s songs. Sung with a constant
and rich legato, and with well-chosen modulations of
tone quality, it is immediately effective. Number 9,
<em>Mit Myrthen und Rosen</em>, is much admired by musicians;
it is unlike most of Schumann in giving an unusual
lyric freedom to the voice part, but the accompaniment,
with its delicate inner voices, suggests what was to come
later. The <em>Myrthen</em> of opus 25 include some of Schumann’s
finest. The very first, <em>Widmung</em> (‘Dedication’),<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
is one of the great songs of all time. Such passionate
ardor a composer has seldom been able to compress
into a few notes. The fine legato contrasting melody,
introduced by an impressive enharmonic change, is the
purest of German lyricism. The accompaniment, while
conventional enough in its relation to the voice part,
shows the freedom, and especially the wide separation
of notes, which was to flower so magnificently in the
<em>Dichterliebe</em>. The great danger in singing this song is
that of making it sound hurried or ‘choppy.’ Here, as
so often in song singing, the correct tempo is half the
battle. Let the singer aim to avoid ‘choppiness,’ on the
one hand, and dragging, on the other, and the correct
tempo will come almost automatically, though, of
course, no tempo can hold a song together if there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>not a firm legato behind it. <em>Der Nussbaum</em> (‘The Almond
Tree’) is another immortal melody. In this song
the accompaniment enters as a lyric element, as it
rarely does in Schubert except in interludes. The half-phrase
of the voice with its answering phrase from the
piano—this is an effect of striking charm. The supporting
part of the accompaniment shows the principle
of the simple broken (or ‘harp’) chord used more freely
than had been the common custom. In <em>Die Lotusblume</em>
(‘The Lotus Flower’) the novelty in the accompaniment
is very different—a slow and impressive melody
arising out of the lowest bass notes of the harmonic
support.</p>

<p>In these songs we see the piano beginning to sing
with the voice on terms of equality. In number 15,
one of the ‘Hebrew Melodies’ of Byron, we see the
formal accompaniment very highly developed. It has
become quite pianistic, with much figuration, and a
profusion of chromatic passings which remind us of
Schumann piano pieces. Yet this is a true accompaniment
in the old-fashioned sense, and not, as in some
of the later songs, an independent piano composition.
<em>Lass mich ihm am Busen hängen</em> and <em>Du bist wie
eine Blume</em> are charming examples of Schumann at his
simplest. We cannot point out the precise elements of
beauty, yet we feel that the music subtly matches the
simplicity of the words. In other terms, we see in
these two songs that ultimate test of artistic mastery—the
command over style. And in these instances the
style subsists quite as much in the voice as in the piano
part. The great piano stylist of the preceding decade
has begun to turn his peculiar gifts to pure vocal music.
The grandiose <em>Talismane</em> (‘Talismans’) is perhaps not
of high value musically, but it shows the engaging freshness
of Schumann’s romantic invention. The three
Burns songs—‘Somebody,’ ‘The Highlander’s Farewell,’
and ‘The Highland Cradle Song’—are simply melodies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
of great beauty and are to be sung as such. The last-named
offers a problem to the singer in the need of
combining the somewhat jerky, rocking motion of the
cradle with the calm monotony which overspreads the
whole.</p>

<p>The five songs, opus 27, need not detain us. Of the
three songs from Emmanuel Geibel the last, <em>Der Hidalgo</em>
(‘The Hidalgo’), is particularly interesting. As
an attempt at local color (which was never Schumann’s
<em>forte</em>) it has no special value. But the vigor of the
accompaniment, with its varied bolero rhythm, and the
quiet passages on the words ‘<em>Die Schönen von Sevilla</em>,’
suggest once more some of the wonderful piano passages
of the <em>Dichterliebe</em>.</p>

<p>Of the three songs, opus 31, we must note <em>Die Löwenbraut</em>
(‘The Lion’s Bride’) as a fine example of the
larger ballad form. This form Schubert frequently
attempted without ever achieving better than mediocrity.
And Schumann himself failed miserably at it
in his later years. But in the present instance he gave
us a model. The declamatory voice part agrees accurately
with the prosody of the text without ever quite
losing a melodic value. The accompaniment of the
first section consists only of occasional supporting
chords. It is recitative, but, unlike the <em>recitativo secco</em>
of Italian opera, it is recitative raised to the status of
music. The singer should be careful never to lose the
musical beauty of the voice part and at the same time
not try to force it into a formal melody. The middle
section illustrates admirably a device which Schumann
used better than any other of his time. This is
the development of a long passage of vocal music from
a single phrase. The vocal part in this middle section
is scarcely more than the repetition, in many forms and
keys, of one short and very lovely phrase. This device
is peculiarly suited to the ballad, which, being in constant
forward motion, is liable to lose coherence if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
music does not offer some basis of unification. Schumann
used the same device later in his ballad, <em>Blondels
Lied</em> (‘Blondel’s Song’), and here with even more
poetic fitness; for the phrase on which the piece is
built up is that accompanying the constantly recurring
refrain of the text and as it develops seems to infuse
the whole work with this single burning message.</p>

<p>One more of Schumann’s ballads should be mentioned
in this place—the universally known <em>Die beiden
Grenadiere</em> (‘The Two Grenadiers’). Technically the
song offers little of interest beyond the composer’s
clever and appropriate abbreviation of the <em>Marseillaise</em>
at the end. The overwhelming gusto of the ballad is
too obvious to demand more than passing mention.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The twelve songs to words by Kerner, opus 35, include
several of especial interest. In this group we see
Schumann’s development of the piano part well under
way. Each song offers an accompaniment which is a
study in pianistic style. Number 2, <em>Stirb, Lieb’ und
Freund</em>, has an austere polyphonic support, in the style
of Bach, suggesting the majesty of some old cathedral.
Number 3, <em>Wanderlust</em>, is a buoyant and youthful melody,
and number 6, <em>An das Trinkglass</em>, a fine romantic
chorale. Numbers 6 and 8, <em>Stille Liebe</em> and <em>Stille Thränen</em>,
are intimate psychological studies. In the former
the sustained bass melody beneath the hesitating treble
of the accompaniment suggests the apprehension of
the lover who is obliged to wait in silence. The latter
obtains a charming effect with the soft repeated chords
of the piano part and offers a typical Schumann ending
in the intermingling melodies of the close. The six
songs opus 36 contain one which has become a German
folk-song—<em>An den Sonnenschein</em>, a melody which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
concentrates the spirit of dignity and sincerity of German
popular music.</p>

<p>In the Eichendorff <em>Liederkreis</em>, opus 39, there are
four songs of the very highest rank. Number 2, <em>Intermezzo</em>,
with its soft syncopation in the accompaniment,
offers a suggestive contrast with the songs of Schubert
and shows how far musical technique had moved in
ten or fifteen years. It is the simplest of melodies, but
one with a certain atmospheric indecision, strongly contrasting
with the downrightness and clearness of outline
which Schubert best loved. Number 3 in this
group, <em>Waldesgespräch</em>, is as lovely a melody as Schumann
ever wrote. It might be called a ballad, with its
story of the knight who wandered into the forest at
night, finding there a lady in distress, attempting to
help her, and discovering that he was in the power of
the witch, the Lorelei, who lies in wait for strong men.
The lovely thirds of the accompaniment seem to spread
the mystery of evening over the song, and when the
witch announces her identity the music takes on a momentary
grandeur that suggests the old tales of gods
and heroes. The song is full of fine and expressive
effects. But these do not exist in detail; they rather
spring unconsciously out of the musical design. The
singer who attempts to make the song too expressive
is sure to go astray. If it is sung primarily for its musical
beauty it becomes of itself a masterpiece of expressive
story-telling. Above all, as so often in great songs,
a good legato is the first and chiefest of the virtues.
Number 12 of the Eichendorff series is the <em>Frühlingsnacht</em>
(‘Spring Night’), with its magical triplet accompaniment.
Number 5 is the famous <em>Mondnacht</em> (‘Moonlight
Night’). Here again we have a song that quite
defies analysis. The voice part consists solely of a
two-line phrase several times repeated. The first three
times it closes on the dominant, the last time on the
tonic, with a deep and satisfying sense of repose. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
any but a master hand this form would become monotonous.
But with Schumann’s mysterious accompaniment
it is all magic. The close is peculiarly characteristic.
The voice part comes, as we have said, to a tonic
close, but the accompaniment makes a false cadence
of it and the piano part continues to its own logical
ending. The piano part has become utterly organic
and independent. Played by itself, it would offer no
clew as to where the voice part ended. That deceptive
cadence is Schumann’s ultimatum to the singer. ‘The
song is not ended,’ he seems to say, ‘merely because you
have finished singing. The song is the voice part <em>and</em>
the piano part one and indivisible. If you hurry
through the postlude, or belittle it, or treat it as a useless
appendage to the voice part, you are no artist.
If you consider the voice part more important than
the piano part, or yourself more important than the
song you are singing, go and give your feeble talents
to vaudeville songs.’ And for audiences, too, this song
has a message: the listener who begins to applaud before
the piano part is finished (and there are few even
to-day who do not) is no true listener. Let him go and
listen to a brass band; he has no business with the art-song.</p>

<p>The five children’s songs, opus 40, offer little of interest.
But the cycle, <em>Frauenliebe und Leben</em> (‘Woman’s
Life and Love’), is undoubtedly the most famous
and possibly the greatest song cycle in all musical literature.
The poet, Adalbert von Chamisso, selects
eight crucial moments in woman’s life and puts into
her mouth for each of the eight an exquisite lyric, expressing
with wonderful delicacy her emotions and
moods. The poems are perhaps a trifle exaggerated
in the romantic fashion of the time and certainly do not
altogether tally with the emotions of the modern woman.
But the groundwork of typical psychology is expressed
with such persuasive eloquence and such literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
charm that no one can read the poems without
feeling that he has lived through, in some measure, the
experience of which they tell.</p>

<p>In the first song, <em>Seit ich ihn gesehen</em>, the young girl
has just seen her hero; in a moment, almost, she has
cast her young girlhood behind her; she feels strange
presentiments; she no longer cares for the games of
her sisters; she wishes to be alone; the personality of
her hero seems to be ever present. In the second song
she has come to know him. She makes no secret of
her love; she sings it openly; she is proud of it before
the world. In the next song she has heard his proposal.
‘<em>Ich kann’s nicht fassen, nicht glauben</em>’ (‘I cannot
grasp it, I cannot believe it’), she says, torn between
joy and terror. But in the next song, <em>Du Ring an
meinem Finger</em>, she is apostrophizing her engagement
ring and looking at the long vista of life ahead. Number
5, <em>Helft mir, ihr Schwestern</em>, is sung on the bridal
day. Next, she is in her own home, in the arms of her
husband, vainly attempting to make him understand
why she weeps when she is happiest. In number 7
she is singing a lively but tender lullaby to her newborn
child. In the last song she is singing her grief at
the death of her husband. ‘This is your first cruel act
toward me,’ she says to the dead body. She sees before
her a life of voluntary loneliness, assuaged by
memories of her former happiness.</p>

<p>The music with which Schumann interprets these
songs may justly be called psychological. The term
‘psychological’ is applied freely and indiscriminately
to music and usually without justice. Properly, music
is far too abstract an art to carry any precise meanings.
Yet with the gradual and persistent process of six centuries,
whereby certain musical styles and progressions
have come to be associated with definite moods, there
has grown up a technique which, with a properly sympathetic
audience, may be manipulated to express states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
of soul. Whatever this technique is worth, Schumann,
in his <em>Frauenliebe und Leben</em>, has used it with masterly
power. In the first song he writes a simple, timid
melody, the rhythmic flow interrupted as though by the
hesitation of a fluttering heart. ‘Since my eyes first
beheld him I seem to have been blind.’ The emotion
rises. ‘I care no more for the games of my sisters. I
had rather weep.’ Then comes a lovely phrase of tender
sweetness. Weeping for love is a precious delight.
The broken melody continues. Not until the last bar
does the hearer become conscious of its full charm and
formal beauty. The second song, ‘He, the Noblest of
All,’ is in a very different mood—proud and exuberant
expression. It has a grand lyric sweep which only
a fine artistic taste can restrain from a somewhat cheap
pompousness. The middle section returns for a moment
to the girl’s feelings of timidity. ‘Turn from me
before it is too late,’ she says; ‘I am not worthy of
you.’ Schumann has chosen not to interrupt the flow
of his song here. To express the more timid mood
he employs dissonance and chromatic progression,
which finally resolves into the original clear-cut strain.
Throughout the symphonic unity of the song is preserved.
The third song, ‘I cannot grasp it,’ returns to
the spirit of the first. It is an agitated allegretto movement.
The voice part follows the words with utmost
faithfulness; it is almost a free recitative, interrupted
only by one gentle lyric phrase on the words, ‘I am
thine forever.’ Yet here, again, there is a true melody
throughout, and a charming one, but it seems only to
peep out from behind the detached notes. The fourth
song, ‘Thou, Ring upon My Finger,’ has much the design
and movement of the second, though quieter. In
the fifth, too, melody is dominant. In the sixth the
composer returns to the declamatory style. Here the
delineative music lies chiefly in the accompaniment,
with lovely modulations and snatches of melody suggesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
the timid wonder of the wife in her happiness.
The voice part hardly comes to an end at all, but fades
away on the words ‘Thy picture,’ while the piano takes
up the tale. The next song, the lullaby, musically the
least important of the eight, is a simple strophic melody
with a broken chord accompaniment. The last is
recitative pure and simple. The rests between phrases
seem broken with sobs, out of which there rises the
heroism of a determination to face life alone and without
complaint. The emotional power of those few
notes of recitative is beyond description. The stark
tragedy of the opening lines becomes clouded over, as
it were, with tears, and the music melts into calm grayness
as the woman sings, ‘The veil falls; I withdraw into
myself, where I have thee and my lost happiness.’ And
then, as the great quiet of loneliness settles down, the
piano sings softly the whole of the first song, the early
glow of delicate color when the girl first beheld her
hero. And we seem to see ahead the years of loneliness
softened only by sweet memory.</p>

<p>No group of songs has ever more perfectly achieved
the union of words and music. The faults of this cycle
on the artistic side are the faults of the generation.
People’s views of life have changed much since Chamisso
set maiden hearts a-fluttering. The notion of
the wife as the bounden slave of her husband—a notion
only a step or two removed from the theory of
the harem—has given place to the healthier view of
the wife as one of two high contracting parties. One
cannot help noticing in Chamisso’s poems how small
a part the child plays in the woman’s life. And the
idea that upon the death of the husband the woman’s
thoughts should be solely of her own past rather than
of her child’s future is little short of repulsive. These
are the faults of an individualistic, a pessimistic, an
over-sentimental age. They are reflected in the spirit
of the music. Since then our art, if it has become more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
sensuous, has also become more vigorous. Schumann’s
work was for an age rather than for all time.</p>

<p>In the singing of these songs the singer must avoid
stressing too much the declamatory character of the
three slow ones as well as the melodic exuberance
of the others. The songs seem on paper to be detached
and broken. All the more they must be sung smoothly,
discreetly, without undue emphasis. The singer will
not go far wrong in following the notes and the time
signatures quite literally. Many a singer has been astonished
by that old miracle of art—that if the notes
are sung as written they will work their own magic.
The composer has seen to that. If a song relies wholly
on a ‘singer’s personality,’ the composer has failed. So
in these songs pure intonation, just rhythm, and careful
diction will interpret the poet truly. If the singer finds
that with the observance of these values the songs do
not express what they should, let him put them aside
for a while. As his technical artistic powers grow
he will find that the songs have grown along with
them. If he is much concerned about bolstering up
the song by giving it ‘expression,’ he is sure to be on the
wrong track.</p>

<p>Of the ‘Romances and Ballads,’ opus 45, we need
only notice the spirited <em>Es zogen zwei rüst’ge Gesellen</em>.
Opus 48, however, is the immortal <em>Dichterliebe</em> series,
probably the most individual of all Schumann’s song
works. Here, again, we find Schumann suffering somewhat
from the faults of romanticism. To put the case
briefly, he took Heine seriously. Heine himself, we cannot
but feel, was not so taken in by his own poetry.
In addition to the ever-present grin which is in almost
every one of his lyrics there is a certain playful quality,
as though he were only teasing the sentimentalism of
the human heart. If Heine suffered only a hundredth
part of the pangs described in his mass of short poems
he must have had more love affairs than any one man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
could attend to in three lifetimes. The truth is, Heine
was dealing with moods, and Schumann supposed he
was dealing with emotions. We see the contradiction
to an almost grotesque degree in the song <em>Ich grolle
nicht</em> (‘I do not complain’). Here the poet tells his love
that he will not complain of his unhappiness because,
though she goes about in diamonds, he has seen in a
dream that she, too, is unhappy. This is pretty sentiment
and charming playful heroics. Tragedy it is not.
But Schumann’s music is tragedy of the noblest strain.
It strikes an emotional depth which the composer rarely
equalled. To such music the Puritans of Cromwell’s
time might have left their wives and children to go out
and fight on the side of the Lord. We have said that
Heine has nowhere in his poems written words that
might be put into the mouth of a hero. But in this case
Schumann wrote music that a hero might have sung.
Perhaps if Schumann’s sense of humor had been a
little more human and a little less literary he might
have seen the incongruity. But it would have been an
unfortunate event, for it would have cost the world
the wonderful music of this song. Indeed, many of
the greatest works of art would never have been created
if their authors had possessed a keen sense of humor.</p>

<p>Generally, however, Schumann did not make this
mistake. In nearly every other one of the <em>Dichterliebe</em>
songs he found music which was as gossamer, as little
fundamental, as Heine’s words. To some students they
may seem at first cold and pedantic. Certainly they
do not draw their greatness from melodic charm.
Merely as melodies, few of these songs would have
lived to this day. Undoubtedly their first appeal is a
technical one—to the musical theorist and the pianist
as well as to the singer. But this is by no means to say
that they lack poetry. It is merely that their poetry is
concealed and reveals itself only to him who has mastered
and understood their finer technical appeal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Take, for instance, the ninth song, <em>Das ist ein Flöten
und Geigen</em> (‘I hear the flutes and violins’). The rejected
lover hears from a distance the orchestra playing
for dancing at the wedding of his beloved. The
accompaniment is a waltz rhythm, with repeated notes
deftly inserted to suggest perhaps the trumpets of the
band. The waltz is steady and continuous. It has none
of the sensuous softness, none of the simplicity and balance
of phrase which we are accustomed to in popular
waltzes. It tinkles on continuously, without an opportunity
to draw a breath—and hence seems at first
glance aimless. Instead of the engaging warmth we
expect from waltzes, it gives a chilling effect. And
that, of course, is exactly the effect it had on the rejected
lover. It is a tinkly, monotonous waltz, perhaps
heard through the winter air. The voice has a little half
melodic, half declamatory complaint, but it seems almost
independent of the piano part. When the voice
rests that waltz is still going on, throbbing, monotonous.
Now, any indifferent pianist will make a sorry affair of
this accompaniment. It demands the most delicate and
exact finger work, the nicest regard for rhythm, the
most delicate modulating of tone power. It must be
played almost without pedal, and it reveals instantly
any slip in the pianist’s technique. It might almost be
published independently as a piano étude. The singer
must deliver his part with great delicacy of diction and
achieve expression on the most limited scale. The
piece has no contrasts. It is so closely bound together
that a single omission of a note will spoil the whole design.
Decidedly this is not an interesting song to a bad
musician. Every detail is a difficulty. If he cannot
master it, it remains to him cold and austere. But to
him who can master it, it becomes a rare delight. Each
technical difficulty becomes an expressive quality; the
austerity becomes only poetry more delicately refined.
The whole is a challenge to the taste of the singer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
the accompanist. The song, within its limits, is without
a flaw.</p>

<p>Much the same can be said of every one of the <em>Dichterliebe</em>
songs. There is no superficial similarity between
any two. Each one uses technical means which
are employed in no other. In each the technical means
are nicely adapted to the character of the music. Each
one of the accompaniments calls upon a different department
of the pianist’s art. Each is developed, technically,
in its own manner and in the manner of no
other one of Schumann’s songs. In other words, each
of these remarkable songs has that thing known as
style. Each has a personality as distinct as the personality
of one interesting man is distinct from that of another.
The accompaniments might be published alone
as Essays in Style. Such an achievement marks a development
of detailed technical resource hitherto unheard
of. From it all later German and French song
writers directly derive. Nor must it be assumed that
the voice parts are uninteresting or unvocal. Quite the
contrary. Only in these songs, as in none that had preceded
them, the voice parts are not the songs, nor a
small part of the songs; the songs are inconceivable, are
non-existent, except as voice and piano parts intimately
combined.</p>

<p>Songs 1 and 2, ‘In the Wondrous Lovely Month of
May’ and ‘From Out My Tears,’ are simple melodies,
charming, but little self-conscious, demanding something
of the singer’s art and learning if they are not
to sound trivial. The third song, ‘The Rose, the Lily,
the Dove, the Sun,’ is a technical <em>tour de force</em>, an extremely
brief and rapid little piece, demanding the utmost
delicacy of intonation and enunciation, which
might almost be sung in a single breath. The fourth
song, ‘When I Look Into Thine Eyes,’ is a sort of duet
between the voice and the piano. Each phrase from
the singer is tenderly echoed in the accompaniment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
The whole melody has a touching simplicity. Number
6 looks austere. Here Schumann’s effort to maintain
a single style (both technically and poetically) throughout
has perhaps led him to dispense with detailed expression.
‘In the Rhine, the Holy River,’ runs the first
line, and the accompaniment depicts the Rhine flowing,
ever so slowly and majestically, past the Cathedral of
Cologne. And, since he is particularly interested in
these songs in homogeneity of style, he makes the
whole song flow along to this type of accompaniment.
If the singer is chiefly interested in exhibiting his voice,
he will leave this song in disgust as cold and unpoetic.
But let him beware that his real motive be not the difficulty
he experiences in singing it well.</p>

<p>The following song is the famous <em>Ich grolle nicht</em><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> (‘I
do not complain’), which is easily one of the great songs
of the world. Accepting the words as real tragedy, we
must pronounce the music one of the noblest expressions
of emotion in all song literature. The quiet and
dignified melodic line of the voice part seems to suggest
the hero’s stoic acceptance of his fate. The repeated
chords of the accompaniment, moving in solemn
progression, reflect the calm of a great soul. And the
marvellous bass part, moving deeper and deeper down
the scale, calling forth from the modern grand piano
its most terrible and wonderful tones, till the very soul
seems to quiver in response—this furnishes a foundation
of grandeur which might have served for a tragedy
of Æschylus. But Schumann rarely repeated this
achievement. He was a gentle poet or an ardent technician,
or, in his later years, a verbose bore, but only
rarely, as in this instance, a tragedian.</p>

<p>The eleventh song of the cycle, ‘A Young Man Loved
a Maiden,’ has a simple melody suited to the spirit of
the words, supported by a lilting accompaniment admirably
unified in style. The next song, ‘On the Bright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>Summer Morning,’ is dignified by the device of the continued
downward arpeggio in the accompaniment.
The thirteenth song, ‘I Wept in My Dreams,’ is especially
interesting. The voice part is almost a recitative,
and the accompaniment a sort of orchestral commentary.
Sometimes deep chords form the only support
for the singer, sometimes little rhythmical phrases tell
their message. The whole suggests admirably the effort
of the speaker to disentangle his dreams from the
mental mist that surrounds them. The fourteenth song,
‘Each Night in Dreams,’ is one of the most appealing
melodies Schumann ever wrote. The last of the series,
<em>Die alten, bösen Lieder</em> (‘The Old and Evil Songs’), is
a magnificent example of Schumann’s power to put
subtle moods into his accompaniment. The mocking
spirit of the words, the grandiose strutting of little emotions,
the legendary paraphernalia which is invoked
by the poet—these seem to be embalmed in this tricky
but brilliant accompaniment. The postlude to the cycle
is the melody of song number 12, freely developed.</p>

<p>The later songs of Schumann can be summed up in a
few lines. There were a few written in the 1840 period,
apparently cast aside as unworthy and inadvisedly
published later when Schumann’s matchless faculty of
self-criticism had become weak and dim. Opus 51 contains
a delightful folk-like song, ‘When I into the Garden
Go.’ Opus 53 contains the fine ballad, <em>Blondel’s
Lied</em>, already described. Opus 79 is a book of songs for
children, containing two or three, notably <em>Käuzlein</em>,
<em>Sandmann</em>, and <em>Marienwürmchen</em>, which bring back a
breath of the youthful romantic Schumann. But nothing
could be more pitiful than the settings which Schumann
about this time gave to some of Goethe’s finest
poems—especially the <em>Wilhelm Meister</em> and the ‘Western
Divan’ songs. The settings of Queen Mary Stuart’s
poems, published in 1852, are perhaps better than the
other pieces of the period, especially the prayer, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
has an appealing melody and much harmonic freedom
in the accompaniment. But the ballads of this later period—including
Schiller’s ‘The Glove,’ Hebbel’s ‘Fair
Hedwig,’ and others—are mere collections of musical
bombast. Let us draw the veil. For soon Schumann was
to throw himself into the Rhine in attempted suicide, a
martyr to the vigorous activity of fifteen years—years,
one of which produced the remarkable songs which we
have just been studying, by which alone his name need
be known in song literature.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Among Schumann’s contemporaries in song literature
we may mention his wife Clara, his friend and
rival Mendelssohn, together with several lesser known
composers—Reinecke, Volkmann, and Jadassohn—and,
finally, two important men, Chopin and Glinka. Clara
Schumann (born 1819, Clara Josephine Wieck, died
1896) was a talented composer and a virtuoso pianist
who worked throughout her married life in closest
sympathy with her husband. Three of her songs appear
in Schumann’s opus 37—namely, numbers 2, 4,
and 11, <em>Er ist gekommen</em>, <em>Liebst du um Schönheit</em>, and
<em>Warum willst du and’re fragen?</em> These songs must be
ranked high, for their scholarly command of style and
their general finish, though they are obviously not
works of special inspiration. The best of the three is
probably the second, in which the composer makes extensive
use of one of her husband’s devices, that of
repeating a single phrase in various forms and building
up the song as out of a single shape of stone. The last
named of the three songs also has a good melody to its
credit.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn wrote many songs during his short lifetime
and was probably the best known of all song-writers
of the forties. But his work in this department
has all but passed into oblivion. They are not ambitious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
efforts. They make no attempt to strike out new
paths; they have no interest in sounding depths of emotion;
they are content with the old forms and the old
formulas of accompaniment. The best that can usually
be said of them is that they are pleasing in melody
and faultlessly graceful according to canons of correctness.
On the whole, the ones best worth singing
are those which are consciously <em>volkstümlich</em>. Among
these we may name the very beautiful <em>Es ist bestimmt
in Gottes Rath</em>, opus 47, No. 7; <em>O Jugend, O schöne
Rosenzeit</em>, opus 57, number 4; <em>An die Entfernte</em>, opus
71, number 3; and <em>Das Lieblingsplätzchen</em>, opus 99,
number 3, words from <em>Des Knaben Wunderhorn</em>.
‘Italy,’ in opus 8, and <em>Im Herbst</em>, in opus 9, have a very
real charm. <em>Neue Liebe</em>, in opus 19, suggesting the elf
riding through the forest, is about as near as Mendelssohn
ever got to descriptive music in his accompaniments.
The <em>Frühlingslied</em> in opus 71 is by all means
one of the best of his songs, showing contrast and depth
of mood and rising to a thrilling climax on the words
<em>Bist nicht allein</em>.</p>

<p>Another song writer of peculiarly Germanic cast was
Karl Reinecke (born 1821), friend of Schumann and
Mendelssohn and protégé of the latter, who was for
thirty-five years director of the Gewandhaus concerts
at Leipzig. Reinecke’s songs cannot be called great,
but they have to a remarkable degree insinuated themselves
into the affections of the German people. They
are at their best when they are nearest to the <em>Volkslied</em>,
showing the German genius of achieving deep and
noble expression in the simplest forms. We may mention
especially the Children’s Songs, opus 37, of which
the best are the lilting lullaby, <em>Wenn die Kinder
schlafen ein</em>, and the moving <em>Gebet zur Nacht</em>. The essential
wholesomeness of his talent is shown in the
<em>Singspiel</em>, <em>Ein Abenteuer Händels</em> (‘An Adventure of
Handel’s), of which the very simple song, <em>Lied so treu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
und herzlich</em>, is typical. His song cycle, <em>Schneewittchen</em>
(for soprano and contralto with chorus of women’s
voices), is excellent in its way. The simple prologue is
a thing of great beauty, and <em>Schneewittchen’s</em> song, <em>In
seiner Kammer</em>, has a charming archaic style, recalling
the long and flowing lines of the Minnesong. Salomon
Jadassohn (1831-1901) and Robert Volkmann (1815-1883)
were likewise successful song writers whose lyric
work has largely passed into obscurity. Carl Friedrich
Curschmann (1805-1841), a pupil of Spohr, was a prolific
and extremely popular writer of songs in a sentimental
and popular vein, marked by the sensuous quality
which Franz Abt used so richly. An artist of more
varied talents was Karl Gottfried Wilhelm Taubert
(1811-1891), who held important official positions in
Berlin, chiefly in the Royal Opera, and composed
numerous songs. The best of these are the <em>Kinderlieder</em>,
of which the charming ‘Lullaby’ is still popular.</p>

<p>Chopin’s Polish Songs, opus 74, are his only vocal
works. They purport to be arrangements of Polish
folk-songs, but it is to be doubted whether they are to
any great extent popular melodies. Probably Chopin
drew freely on Polish motives and rearranged them to
suit himself. However that may be, some of them are
masterpieces. ‘The Maiden’s Wish’ is well known to
concert audiences through Liszt’s arrangement of it for
piano. The <em>Bacchanal</em> is a glorious piece, admirable
for an encore number, the simplest of quatrain tunes,
but overpowering in its frenzied energy. ‘The Spring’
is a charming thing, undoubtedly of folk origin, a tender
alternation of major and minor which would become
monotonous except for its ineffable beauty.
‘Melancholy,’ a folk-like tune with a genuine Slavic
touch, is likewise among the best, and ‘My Sweetheart,’
which recalls the Tyrolese folk-songs, is well worth
knowing. These songs are of the simplest character.
The last two of the collection, the ‘Lithuanian Song’ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
‘Poland’s Funeral Song,’ are more pretentious—rather
like scenas than <em>Lieder</em>—and in spite of certain beauties
are overweighted with pretense.</p>

<p>Another song writer who does not usually find his
way into song lists should be mentioned here. This
is Michail Ivanovitch Glinka (1804-1857), founder of
the national school of Russian music. Glinka was a
man of remarkable talent, one who was able to fuse
Italian grace, French subtlety, and German solidity
into an individual style of his own, and to develop out
of it an original native touch which had never appeared
before in Russian music. Of his eighty-five or more
songs (exclusive of those in his operas) a great number
are in the thin and pretentious style of the day.
But from a few of them there speaks real genius—the
forerunner of the wonderful Russian song literature
of recent times. The grand Hebrew Song from the incidental
music to ‘Prince Kholmsky’ is the work of a
man in whom much learning could not stifle the personal
message. Another song, ‘Our Rose,’ is in a mixed
rhythm which foreshadows the wonderful songs of
Moussorgsky, and yet another, a ‘Traveller’s Song,’
makes use of the lively two-four rhythm which has
since come to be associated with the Russian Cossacks.
The lyric known as ‘Ilia’s Song’ and that entitled ‘Deserted
Land’ both show the personal genius of the composer.
We should also mention ‘Doubt,’ <em>Meine Ruh’
ist hin</em>, and ‘The Lark’ as among his best. It is not likely
that singers will dig up these old songs for study, but
Glinka’s distinguished name should not be forgotten in
the examination of the wonderful Russian song literature
which took its rise from him.</p>

<small>THE CONTEMPORARIES OF SCHUBERT AND SCHUMANN</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The spirit of the ‘thirties’ in France; the lyric poets of the French
romantic period—Monpou and Berlioz—Song-writers of Italy; English song-writers—Robert
Frans—Löwe and the art-ballad.</p>
</div>


<p>In another volume<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> we have seen what a remarkable
wave of literary romanticism swept over France in
the late twenties and early thirties of the nineteenth
century. There has rarely been an age of more pronounced
lyricism, rarely an age which created in a
short time so many excellent lyrics. There were a number
of fine talents working at this time. The purely
literary virtuosity was remarkable. The radicalism of
their method was marked, and the strangeness of their
product revealed a movement in all the vigor of its
early youth. In their insistence on the sensuous quality
of words the romanticists of the thirties looked forward
to the France of the early twentieth century, with
its hazy, indefinite outlines. The early romanticists reduced
the sound of words to a fine art. The later impressionists
reduced it almost to an exact science.</p>

<p>The central tenet of the romanticists was freedom—freedom
from the old classic forms, freedom from a
host of conventions which governed the French language
in poetry, and freedom especially from the severity
and reserve of the classic ideal. To the poet of the
Napoleonic age any violence of manner was an error
in taste. He shunned it as he would have shunned
the smell of garlic on a peasant’s breath. To the poet
of the age of Louis Philippe any conscious reserve of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>manner was a coldness, a lack of genuine human feeling,
an artistic lie. The emotions as well as the artistic
sense must be stirred. And they must be stirred both
by the picturing of emotion and by the beauty of lovely
sounds. We have occasion to notice throughout the
art of the nineteenth century an increasing insistence
on the sensuous (it cannot be too often repeated). It
shows in every department of artistic life. In poetry
it is shown in a development of the mellifluousness of
rhythm and suggestiveness of word. The French romanticists
did for French poetry what Shelley did for
English and what Poe did for American. These three
qualities—freedom, emotionalism, and sensuousness—we
may accept as the dominant notes of French romantic
poetry.</p>

<p>High above all literary men of the time towered Victor
Hugo. This man, along with Shakespeare, Dante,
and Goethe, was one of the greatest virtuosos of language
the world has ever seen. Pity only that he had
not the genius of the other three! To his time he
seemed supreme. But since his death his reputation
has been steadily declining. We have come to see how
much of his work was only—language. He attained
his emotional effects through emotional words rather
than through emotional interpretation. He was incurably
melodramatic and only his power of language
saves a large share of his work from falling to the
level of any yellow-back novel or the cheap theatre
romance. He attempted to cover the whole of life—to
interpret the criminal, the hero, and the child, as well
as woman in every one of her moods and states. But
through all the work, even the magnificent scenes of
<em>Les Misérables</em>, the true human touch is somehow lacking.
Everything is sacrificed to the great god Effect, to
whom alone Hugo offered his most precious burnt offerings.
Much of his work was in the form of short lyrics,
but it is in this department that his reputation has suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
most in the half century just past. The lyric demands
a naïveté which Hugo, already famous at the
age of seventeen, never had. His lyric poems are always
overweighted with their language, always too foreign
to the spirit of the folk-poem, which is at the
foundation of all lyric expression. They were, however,
freely set to music, as was inevitable, and furnish
a goodly share of the texts for the song literature of
the time.</p>

<p>Lamartine in his lyric work suffered considerably
from the disease of the time—over-emphasis. He
ranked as a philosopher in his day—much the sort of
philosopher which Maeterlinck pretends to be to-day.
He had a goodly share of the didactic in his makeup,
as Hugo never had (except toward the end of his life,
when didacticism became the fashion). As a result we
can hardly place Lamartine any higher than Hugo as
a lyric poet. But his ardent religious sense, combined
with his fine power over eloquent language, made him
greatly loved in his day and as a result his texts enter
largely into the song literature of the time. Béranger
had much more of the true lyric in him. His language
was simple, his message popular. He was always more
at home in the streets than in the drawing room. In
some ways he might be called the Kipling of his time.
He appealed to the French sense of national pride,
dwelling upon the glorious history of the past and the
nobility of the French character with all the paraphernalia
of the jingo poet. In particular he resuscitated,
or rather created, the Napoleonic myth. The age in
which he wrote was a new one, containing few of the
immediate conditions of Napoleon’s time. A new generation
had sprung up, a generation which had not experienced
the heartaches and miseries of the Napoleonic
wars, or else had forgotten them, and thought of
the time only as the age in which France single-handed
had defeated the whole of Europe. Napoleon was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
longer the epileptic and egomaniac who had shattered
the fine ideals of the French Revolution and for his
own ambition brought France almost to the verge of
ruin. He was now <em>le petit caporal</em> who had fought with
his men on the bridge at Arcola, had eaten the same
food and slept on the same hard ground with his army.
The myth was tremendously attractive, and made it
possible some twenty years later for a shallow adventurer
to become Emperor of France (merely because
he happened to be the nephew of the great Bonaparte)
and bring France once more to the verge of ruin to
please personal and dynastic ambition. In the creation
of this myth Béranger’s sense of the picturesque and
popular served him well. As a lyric poet, apart from
the peculiar nature of his subject matter, he would
hardly be remembered. The most genuine and most
refined of the literary men of the time was Musset, for
many years the lover of Georges Sand and Chopin’s successor
in her affections. His work partook far less of
the spectacular than that of his contemporaries. He
was interested in interpreting the human soul and he
did his work with the most delicate literary art. His
inspiration was fresh and creative; his workmanship
was finished to the last degree. It is a great pity that
he had no Schubert to set his poems to music. A musician
of the stature of Musset might have created a
distinctive and great French song literature fifty years
earlier than it came.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>If the right composer had been at hand French song
literature in the nineteenth century might have equalled
the German, for the conditions seemed to be ripe. But
the French musical tradition for many decades was
extraordinarily emasculated, and in no department of
musical activity did this show so plainly as in the songs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
With a few exceptions the French songs from 1830 to
1890 show very few qualities of creative vigor. The
ideal was suavity and facility. Doubtless there was beneath
the smooth melodies a subtlety of suggestion that
gave them a certain artistic value, but this quality is
peculiarly French, and without other elements of interest
the French songs could hardly attain any great international
vogue. It is astonishing—the sameness of
these songs which appear in volumes, with eternal
repetition and rigid convention. The sentimentalism
of the period dominates the whole song output. The
composers were extraordinarily timid; the melodies
followed the same suave line, and the harmonies were
the same eternal succession. The tradition of good
taste became little better than a worship of the accredited
and commonplace.</p>

<p>The one composer who was markedly free of this
fault was, of course, Hector Berlioz, one of the most
powerful geniuses in all French music. There is little
to connect his work with that of other French composers:
in many ways he was their polar opposite. A
certain love for graceful and somewhat cold melody
(a quality he derived from Gluck and not from his
contemporaries), a certain clinging to established forms
(with very revolutionary content), and here ends the
list of similarities. For the rest he carried into his vocal
music the qualities which made his symphonies seem
so wild and so anarchic to his countrymen. His harmonies
were daring in the extreme. His vocal parts
were irregular, without balanced phrases, without regular
succession and contrast of similar sections, without
any of the clearness of outline which is almost the
sole virtue in most of his contemporaries. He modulated
through any number of keys, introduced dissonance
in unheard of quantity, and filled his accompaniment
with rich detail to an extent which to the
taste of his time was nothing short of vulgar. Throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
his work he followed his own whim where other
men would have followed iron convention. But, though
his songs are few in number and though they contain
peculiar difficulties which have prevented their extensive
use in concert programs, they have held their
place in the estimation of musicians far better than
any other French songs of the period. There are no
waste places in these songs. Throughout it is the creative
musician who is speaking. The conventional melodic
phrases and harmonic sequences, when they are
used, have a fine sincerity. When the music is unconventional
it is stimulating and suggestive. The impression
one gets is that of a vigorous, even violent,
brain ceaselessly creating, willing to experiment, willing
to make mistakes, but always writing what he believes
to be his best. His artistic sincerity is shown
by the several versions which exist of some of his songs;
his richness of invention by the variants in these versions.
Most of the songs are highly elaborate and dramatic.
Sometimes, as often happened with Berlioz,
they tend to the pretentious and pompous. They are
never easy to grasp. But each and every one of them
is worth a musician’s study and the student of singing
in particular cannot well afford to let Berlioz remain
a closed book to him.</p>

<p>The earlier songs, written before 1830, are in general
simple and conventional. At times we feel the young
man who has not yet realized his creative powers.
But even these early songs have a high standard compared
to the sort of thing that was being produced at
the time. Before 1830 Berlioz was still under the spell
of Gluck (if, indeed, he ever emerged from it) and his
conventionality is that of the great master of opera
rather than that of the familiar French <em>chanson</em>. ‘The
Dead Shepherdess,’ dating from 1827, is remarkable for
its classic dignity and beauty. The Irish Songs, in 1829
and 1830, composed to words by Thomas Moore, show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
the surging up of the revolutionary fervor which took
hold of him about this time and came to fruit in the
<em>Symphonie Fantastique</em> that so startled and shocked
Parisian audiences. The songs are in the strophic form,
as were most of Berlioz’s songs, but otherwise they
are unusual enough to prove a problem for the singer.
They are by no means steady in quality, and doubtless
there is evidenced a failure on the structural side, an
inability to keep genius within firmly controlled limits.
‘At Sunset’ is typical. It is irregular and so filled with
detail that it tends to become ‘spotty.’ It is obviously
an attempt at atmosphere—at the same atmosphere
upon which the recent French song-writers have built
their reputation. The singer’s problem lies in keeping
these details from protruding from the general design
and still giving them their individual value. The task of
selecting the essential in the song and keeping this to
the fore is truly a task for the singer’s intellect, that intellect
which is called on so little in the mass of French
songs. ‘Rich and Rare’ has much sensuous beauty and
is a real problem in expressive singing. ‘Farewell
Bessy’ is altogether lovely. But the finest of the songs
is the last, the ‘Elegy.’ Here Berlioz reaches a height
of tragic impressiveness which he never equalled in his
songs and equalled only rarely in his symphonic music.
The effect of this song in concert is tremendous.</p>

<p>The song called ‘The Captive’ (three versions of it
exist) is one of the best known and one of the simplest.
Here Berlioz has been content with a conventional accompaniment
and has spent his effort on the melody—an
irregular and somewhat arbitrary melody, but one
with a certain aristocratic charm which the singer must
find for himself. The ‘Villanelle’ is perhaps the best
of all. Here the originality of Berlioz’s genius finds
expression within very narrow limits. The simple old
form is combined with a harmonic energy that is admirable.
‘In the Graveyard’ is a study in the tragic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
mood, unconventional, needless to say, and thoroughly
successful. Other songs which deserve mention are:
‘I Believe in Thee,’ a sentimental love song; ‘On the Lagoon,’
a slow barcarolle in six-eight time; and ‘Zaïde,’
a bolero that is highly effective for concert use.</p>

<p>François Louis Hippolyte Monpou (born 1804; died
1841) was the recognized song-writer of the romantic
movement. He is now little more than a historical
fact. In his early years he was an organist and conductor
of church music, but his ability was not marked
and he drifted looking for something to do. He gained
some local fame in 1828 from his three-part setting of
Béranger’s <em>Si j’étais petit oiseau</em> and was taken up in
the drawing rooms as a representative of the romantic
school. He took the drawing room verdict seriously
and turned out a number of songs to the words of
Hugo, Musset, Béranger, and others. His songs had a
certain popular quality and an effect of boldness which
suited the fancy of the romantic school. But his musicianship
was faulty and his harmony and rhythm
were awkward and unresourceful. After he became established
as a song-writer he took to doing operas, some
of which are melodically effective and dramatically
vigorous.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Italy has for three centuries been deficient in art-songs,
but she has produced a certain amount of lyric
music which the student will discover and sing gladly
from time to time, and a few of her song-writers should
be mentioned here. Giuseppe Mercadante (1795-1870)
was primarily an opera composer, but, unlike most of
the Italian opera writers, produced a goodly number
of songs. These are simple and florid, possessed of a
certain Italian charm, but on the one hand too thin to
rank as true interpretative music, and on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
somewhat too operatic to convey a simple lyrical sentiment.
However, his vogue was great and he may be
considered the originator of the modern Italian song
tradition. The continuer of the tradition was Luigi Gordigiani
(1806-1860), a peasant boy who showed marked
talent for music and carried into his work a feeling for
folk-song which was new to Italian music at the time.
He was one of the first native collectors of folk-music
and one of the first to appreciate it. He is known almost
solely as a song-writer, and so popular have his
songs become and so firmly have they remained in people’s
hearts that he has with some justice been called
‘the Italian Schubert.’ However, we must not be from
this led to suppose that he had anything like Schubert’s
richness of melodic inspiration, musical resource, or
genuine dramatic power. His songs are in every case
supplied with the simplest accompaniment and in form
do not go much beyond the folk-songs which are their
model. They have a certain freedom, a development
which is typical of the art-song rather than the folk-song.
But their materials are of the simplest, and with
their technical sameness and their general melancholy
tinge they tend toward monotony. Among the loveliest
of his songs is <em>La Bianchina</em>, a melody of much sweetness
cast in the strophic form. <em>Il Tempo Passato</em> shows
more energy and passion than is usual in Gordigiani.
Some of his religious songs are effective, especially <em>O
Sanctissima Vergine Maria</em>, which is said to have been
admired by Chopin. We should mention also Gordigiani’s
waltz songs, which are brilliant and effective
without becoming cheap. Another Italian song writer,
and one better known in foreign lands than Gordigiani,
is Ciro Pinsuti (1829-1888), whose output was immense.
He exemplifies Italian grace and suavity and imparted
to his part-songs in particular a beauty which has carried
them to singing societies the world over.</p>

<p>In England in the first part of the nineteenth century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
song writing, as we have seen in another chapter,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> was
at a very low ebb. The chief output of songs was in
the street ballad class and in the slightly superior opera
ballad. The ballad opera of the nineteenth century was
not that of the previous century, of which ‘The Beggar’s
Opera’ was a type. The newer ballad opera was usually
romantic, somewhat elaborate, and composed by
one musician instead of ten. Of this opera ‘The Bohemian
Girl’ by Michael Balfe (1808-1870) is an excellent
example. Three of its ‘ballads’—‘I Dreamt I Dwelt
in Marble Halls,’ ‘The Heart Bowed Down,’ and ‘When
Other Lips’—are among the best known of household
songs. And if we except the omnipresent street ballad
and ‘occasional’ song (such as cheap pæans of
triumph over Napoleon) such lyrics were the chief item
in English song. Their beauty is obvious to everybody.
They deserve their long life and popularity. But it
cannot be said that they are an interpretation of their
text, as is the case in a song by Schubert. In addition
to his opera ballads Balfe has at least one thoroughly
fine song to his credit—‘Killarney,’ said to have been
written on his deathbed. Rarely has a conscious composer
caught the true Irish idiom and flavor as Balfe
did here. Balfe’s once popular setting of Longfellow’s
‘The Day Is Done’ is admirably expressive. Sir Henry
Bishop (1786-1855) and Julius Benedict (1804-1885)
were popular composers of the time, known rather by
their operas than by their songs. But of the group only
William Vincent Wallace (1814-1865), in addition to
Balfe, can be said to have lived. His ‘Maritana’ is still
occasionally performed, and the song, ‘Scenes That Are
Brightest,’ from that work, has a popularity analogous
to that of ‘The Heart Bowed Down.’ But whatever occasional
beauties may have lived from the England of
the early nineteenth century, we must feel how dead
the period was productively. Much of the English music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
of the time is <em>gauche</em> in the extreme, and none of it
shows any of the creative vigor which goes to make
history.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It is hard to say anything about Robert Franz (1815-1892).
All that there is to be said about him he has
said in his songs. He lived the most quiet of lives, hindered
in his work by ill health throughout most of his
maturity. His musical output, if we except a few
pieces of church music, consists almost wholly of songs.
(He composed 279 in all.) He was not ambitious; his
only desire in life seems to have been to do his work
well. He had no qualities of self-advertisement. His
fame came very slowly and for a long time he was
known only among the elect. He was through most
of his life miserably poor and the greater part of his
energy went to work which was not much better than
that of a hack. But he has by this time attained a rank
among the greatest song writers of all time. In some
respects he is supreme. Probably no other song writer,
not even Brahms, produced such a high proportion of
great songs or such an even standard of excellence in
his whole output. He shows little variation or development.
His first songs are as good as his last. All were
the best he could do. Schumann, who discovered and
‘announced’ Franz, as he had so many other notable
composers, wrote of his opus 1 in the <em>Neue Zeitschrift
für Musik</em>: ‘Were I to dwell on all the exquisite details
I should never come to an end.’ It was through
Schumann’s influence that the unknown and modest
musician had his first work published.</p>

<p>When we come to examine Franz’s songs in detail
we discover an astonishing subtlety and variety of
method and expression within the superficially narrow
limits he allowed himself. Probably no other song composer
save Hugo Wolf has made each one of his songs
so perfectly individual. We find this individuality first
in the outline and superficial character of the melody;
next we discover it in the technical methods and devices
used in development and elaboration; finally, we trace
it in all the niceties of ornament and prove the absolute
fitness down to the last note. Franz’s peculiar success
in all this is due, of course, first of all to selection of
themes which are very accurately adjusted to the end
in view. A poetic melody, an accompanying figure
which provides just the right suggestion, and we have
the materials for a fine song. In a majority of cases we
have the whole thematic material for the song in the
first three or four measures. The simple germ is developed
without the introduction of extraneous matter,
yet without a suggestion of vain repetition. When we
consider that the majority of the songs are in the strophic
form (and the strophe is usually very brief) we
may realize the artistry which achieved utter individuality
within the space of a few bars. In other words,
the perfection of Franz’s songs comes not from elaboration
but from selection—the test, as we have so often
pointed out, of the true lyric composer.</p>

<p>Franz’s melody is likely to veil itself against the first
glance. It is always beautiful and well proportioned,
but it so persistently avoids striking effects that it is
apt to seem colorless. But if we listen with our inner
ears we shall find it eloquent. Avoiding the striking,
Franz’s melody also avoids the obvious and at first
hearing we are apt to find it a trifle aimless and meandering.
But its continuous subtle deviations from the
expected are never without purpose, and never, if we
know how to listen, without meaning. Usually, too,
there is little or no obvious design, no striking climax
point, no resounding cadence. But here again we need
only look beneath the surface to discover the most restful
and satisfying architecture. Though the emotional
color may be almost unvarying from beginning to end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
though the final note of the voice may not be on the
tonic and may glide in the piano postlude, yet we discover
that if any note had been changed the whole
would have been less perfect. These qualities we find
in their simplest form in such masterpieces as <em>Widmung</em>
and <em>Bitte</em>, songs simple as any folk-song yet rich
with conscious artistry. Franz’s harmony is not radical
or striking. It contains practically nothing which
could not be found in Schumann before him; we might
almost say that it contains nothing that could not be
found in the Beethoven sonatas. He is fluent though
not frequent with modulation; his greatest radicalism
is a stimulating use of altered chords and passing notes.
In fact, his harmony is in every way more conservative
than that of Schumann; for, whereas Schumann was
professedly an innovator, Franz loved best the old German
tradition—that of the Bach fugues and the Lutheran
chorale.</p>

<p>Franz’s treatment of the words is individual. Few
song writers have ever set their texts with more conscientious
regard for the niceties of metre and accent.
Yet it is musical design and not verbal peculiarities
which determines his melodic line. The melody is always
and beyond all a melody. The perfect marriage
of words and music in Franz comes from his selection
of melodies which would nicely fit the words in hand.
Neither is strained; neither is sacrificed to the other.
In this respect Franz is surpassed by no song writer
who ever lived. Now and then the melody is so handled
as to seem like very reserved declamation, but even
these instances are rare. Franz was not a purist in the
setting of his texts; he did hold strictly to the ‘one syllable
one note’ principle. Not infrequently he uses the
slurred phrase on a single vowel. But we can never
feel that this was done out of a careless disregard for
the integrity of the text. In his accompaniment Franz
is even greater than in his treatment of the voice. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
is here that his extreme artistry becomes most evident.
The accompaniment is always rich, always a thing of
value in itself. Usually it would make a perfectly satisfactory
musical composition alone. It is so well filled
with musical beauties that with a little more emphasis
it might overpower the voice part. But always it is
kept nicely in its proper function. In no other song
writer are the voice and piano parts so perfectly fused.
In Franz’s accompaniments is shown his great musical
resourcefulness. No two are alike. Nearly all the recognized
means are used—solid chords, broken chords,
melodic figurations over a spread bass, four-part chorales
with free passing notes, contrapuntal melodies
against the voice, suggestive devices innumerable. But
in every case the germ principle is simple and is strictly
adhered to throughout. Franz’s accompaniments are,
as a whole, more polyphonic than those of any other
song writer. In the greater part of his songs the inner
notes do not serve merely for harmonic filling-in; they
are parts of individual voices which are preserved in
their integrity. In all these songs there is nothing ambitious
or spectacular. But so deeply based is his musicianship
that we may say that anyone who knows
the Franz songs accurately knows in epitome the whole
development of German classical music. Moreover,
they are the finest of cultural exercises. For one who
has learned to love the Franz songs has learned one
of the most precious things music has to give—the art
of <em>listening</em>.</p>

<p>The germ figures which Franz uses in his accompaniments
are almost endless in their variety. Sometimes
they are, in a restrained way, highly picturesque. We
may point out the triplets in <em>Was pocht mein Herz so
sehr?</em>, the suggestion of ripples in <em>Auf dem Meere</em>, the
broken accompaniment in <em>Es treibt mich hin</em>, the delicate
trill which persists through <em>Ach, wenn ich doch
ein Immchen wär</em>, the long rolling diatonic figure in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
<em>Meeresstille</em>, and so on through innumerable instances.
The attainment of the most exquisite beauty within
the smallest limits may be studied in <em>Widmung</em>, <em>Deine
weissen Lilienfinger</em>, <em>Leise zieht durch mein Gemüth</em>,
and <em>Treibt der Sommer seinen Rosen</em>, the last a remarkable
example of a song built up out of the repetition
of the briefest of units, yet without monotony.
Franz’s range of expression is usually limited to the
tender and graceful. He has not succeeded in the mood
of tragedy or deep emotion. But several of his songs
are powerfully energetic, witness <em>Frühlingsfeier</em> and
<em>Das ist ein Brausen und Heulen</em>. The dramatic element,
too, is almost entirely absent, though in such a
song as <em>Childe Harold</em> we have something approaching
it. The influence of the chorale, of which traces are
to be found in nearly every one of the songs, is predominant
in such ones as <em>Gute Nacht</em>, <em>Wenn sich zwei
Herzen Scheiden</em>, <em>Habt ihr sie schön gesehen</em>, <em>Stille
Liebe</em>, <em>In der Fremde</em>, <em>Der Schmetterling ist in die Rose
verliebt</em>, and <em>Frühling</em>, as well as others already mentioned.</p>

<p>To name all the Franz songs which are distinguished
in musical beauty and workmanship would be to name
the best portion of his life work. But we may point
out as of especial beauty (in addition to those already
named) <em>Auf geheimen Waldespfade</em>, <em>Auf dem Teich</em>,
<em>Der Sommer ist schön</em>, <em>Die Welt ist so öd</em>, <em>Im Friedhof</em>,
<em>Im Walde</em>, <em>Für Musik</em>, <em>Im Mai</em>, <em>Ich hab’ in deinen
Augen</em>, <em>Der junge Tag erwacht</em>, and <em>Er ist gekommen</em>.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>We have seen in a previous chapter how Schubert,
having created one supremely great ballad, failed ever
to write another. So the task of creating the art-ballad
fell not upon his shoulders but upon those of another,
Johann Carl Gottfried Löwe, who was born in North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
Germany in 1796, almost at the same time as Schubert,
and long outlived the gentle Viennese composer. Löwe
wrote a quantity of choral and church music, but he is
chiefly known for his numerous ballads, which he made
known throughout Europe in his own concert tours and
which have pretty well held their own to this day, in
spite of serious drawbacks. Löwe’s songs were almost
solely in the ballad form. To this he gave his best talents,
which were marked though uneven. Undoubtedly
he was an artist, working with sincerity and reserve
in a form which, more than most forms, would tempt a
composer to artistic excess. Add to this the fact that
Löwe was not endowed with a rich fund of musical
ideas (at least from the standpoint of pure beauty)
and we must pay considerable respect to the man who
stuck to his guns as he did and produced such a sincere
and admirable body of work as he did. Löwe’s ballads
are descriptive in the highest degree. Every resource
that the composer has at his command he calls upon to
make the scene pictorial and vivid. In his search for
effects he stumbled upon many musical devices which
must have proved valuable to later composers. His
harmony, considering the time in which he worked,
is free and daring. His modulation goes by direct chromatic
progression to the most remote keys. Dissonance
he uses freely for poignant effect. But the great
fault is that he was not a melodist. Melody is, of
course, not needed in the ballad as it is in the lyric, but
none the less the composer who cannot call forth a
beautiful melody when he needs it must jog along as a
second-rate artist. It is the lack of melody which we
miss most in Löwe’s ballads. Melody is obviously absent
because the composer could not command it, not
because he chose not to use it. Time and again he
writes what is meant to be, and perhaps was believed to
be, a pleasing tune. But too often it is only empty and
angular. It was in developing the form and technique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
of the art-ballad that Löwe performed his chief service
to music.</p>

<p>Apart from this failing in point of melody many of
Löwe’s ballads are altogether admirable. He caught
the spirit of the ballad as few others have, that spirit
expressed so well in Goethe’s words: ‘The ballad requires
a mystical touch, by which the mind of the
reader is brought into that frame of undefined sympathy
and awe which men unavoidably feel when face
to face with the miraculous or with the mighty forces
of nature.’ Löwe’s resource in the invention of picturesque
musical formulas is very great. With his fine
sense of drama he managed to make his best ballads
impressive and moving. In the <em>Erlking</em> or ‘Sir Oluf’ we
feel (if they are well sung) that we are living through
a great life experience with the characters represented.
His <em>Erlking</em> is not comparable with Schubert’s in loveliness.
But it emphasizes the dramatic elements of
the poems as Schubert did not try to and probably
could not have done if he had tried. The galloping
of the horse is represented graphically in the accompaniment.
The three characters speak in three different
kinds of voice—the father’s is quiet and low, the
son’s high and excited, the Erlking’s eerie and unsubstantial.
The Erlking’s speeches are all in G major
and on the notes of the tonic chord. For the effective
delivery of the song there are demanded not only dramatic
fire and intensity of emotional expression, but the
careful differentiation of the three qualities of voice.</p>

<p>One of the finest of the ballads is ‘Sir Oluf,’ in
which there are four speaking characters and an abundance
of picturesque stage machinery. Sir Oluf, riding
through the forest on his way to his wedding, is accosted
by the elves and invited to dance, with the fatal
consequences usual in ballads. Oluf’s ride is described
in a stirring <em>allegro vivace</em> in the introduction, and the
dance of the elves is pictured in a charming passage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
Another of the great ballads, perhaps the best known
of all, is ‘Edward,’ the text being that of the famous
Scotch folk-ballad of the same name. (Brahms wrote
a piano piece on the subject, and also set the words as
a duet.) The dramatic power is gained from the repetition
many times over of an incisive emotional phrase.
The whole effect is broad and tragic. Among the many
others of Löwe’s ballads which are worthy of study and
of frequent inclusion in concert programmes we may
mention ‘Henry the Fowler,’ ‘The Moorish Prince,’ and
‘Odin’s Ride Over the Sea.’</p>

<p>Few composers have given their best to the ballad
form. This is a pity, because no single form of poetry
has such a universal and direct appeal as the condensed
dramatic story in verse. No type of poetry is more
difficult to write with sincerity and human truthfulness.
The ballad has remained almost as it was in the
beginning, the peculiar property of folk-art. It is, on
the other hand, the easiest form for a musician to
abuse, the one which tempts most to cheap and clumsy
effects. Löwe is one of the few composers who has
given his best to the ballad form and, while that best
is far inferior to what a first-rate genius would have
done, it is too stimulating and suggestive to be absent
from any singer’s cultural equipment.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>When we come to Brahms we find perhaps the only
song-writer besides Schubert whose truly memorable
songs number more than fifty. Brahms’ song product
is amazing in its richness, its creativeness, its high average
of excellence. A modern taste, often misled by
mere obvious effectiveness, has pronounced these songs
dull. This notion prevails almost universally among the
superficial, and many an appreciative critic has joined
in the chorus with grudging reservations. The student
in particular is likely to be frightened away from
the Brahms songs by this bogey of ‘dullness’ as well as
by the very considerable difficulty which they offer to
the singer who is inadequately prepared. But in most
cases those who accept this opinion have never studied
the Brahms songs and have not allowed themselves to
become familiar with their beauties. Certainly, even
though certain temperaments may admit the charge of
‘dullness’ against much of the Brahms symphonic and
chamber music, the charge will hold least of all against
the songs. Here we find Brahms the romanticist, the
composer who was master of the art of obtaining sensuous
beauty of melody and richly colored harmony.
We must never forget that Brahms was hailed by Schumann
as the great continuer of the romantic tradition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
for which he himself had fought so hard and so well.
If, in his maturity, Brahms came to regard form and
artistic control at a higher value than his contemporaries
did, it was not because his romantic invention
became exhausted. From the beginning of his life to
the end he was possessed of a rich fund of lovely musical
ideas, and his last works (<em>vide</em> the later Rhapsodies
and the Gypsy Songs) are even more romantic than the
first. Brahms was a ‘classic’ solely because he chose to
be. It would perhaps be truest to say that he was romanticist
in his musical ideas and classicist in his treatment
of them. However, such bandying of terms only
tends to obscure the facts. Let us get to the songs.</p>

<p>Because Brahms worked with more care and reserve
than most of his contemporaries, he must be approached
with some care by the student. Doubtless, if one unfamiliar
with his work turned over his songs at random
the result would be somewhat discouraging.
There is so much more there than meets the eye that
much of his work is certainly uninteresting to the superficial
glance. But there are many songs which must
make an instant appeal by their sheer loveliness. Let
the student who sincerely wishes to appreciate Brahms
begin with these songs. Let us make out a provisional
list of them. It would include: ‘In Strange Lands,’
opus 3; ‘Rest, My Love,’ opus 33; the ‘Folksong’ in opus
7; ‘The Sorrowful One,’ the ‘Serenade,’ and ‘Longing,’
from opus 14; ‘Hey, Bow and Arrow,’ opus 33; ‘Sunday,’
opus 47; the famous Cradle Song, opus 49; ‘Remembrance,’
opus 63; ‘The Lover’s Oath,’ opus 69; ‘Vain
Serenade,’ opus 84; ‘The Virgin’s Lullaby,’ opus 91; the
Sapphic Ode, opus 94; and every one of the Gypsy
Songs, opus 103. To call any of these songs ‘dull’ is
rank foolishness. Their beauty appeals instantly even
to a listener who is in no wise a technical musician.
Sentiment, passion, military frenzy and simple high
spirits are expressed in these songs. They are in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
cases as simple as anything by Schubert, as popular in
character as any folk-song. Let the student learn to
know and love some of these and he will have little
difficulty with the more elaborate songs later on.</p>

<p>The first quality that appeals straight to the heart
in many of the Brahms songs is their large element of
the folk-song. Many of the lyrics bear the title <em>Volkslied</em>,
being musical settings of popular poems, treated
in the popular vein. Brahms was devoted to folk-music
and understood the value of the musical units it contains
in such profusion. A large proportion of his music,
if analyzed to its essentials, will show the folk-song
as its base. His elaborate songs, however abstruse and
self-conscious, may be called only a <em>development</em> of
the folk-song. The development is managed with the
consummate art of the trained musician; but the stuff
of the song is in almost every case a musical unit which
makes an instant appeal. The student is very foolish
if he sees only the development and not the beautiful
music beneath it.</p>

<p>In a large proportion of his songs Brahms has given
the best of his profound musical learning—always in
due proportion and without obtrusion of detail. His
management of polyphonic parts, in the bass or in the
inner voices, is unequalled by any song-writer—save,
perhaps, Franz—and his range of expression is vastly
wider than that of Franz. His complication and intertwining
of rhythms is highly developed, as in his symphonic
music. His harmony is often bold, though never
at the expense of cogency. Whether he is simple or
complex his musicianship is working every moment.
It is this, in the last analysis, which we mean by technical
mastery. The real test of technical excellence is
not the applying of rules out of the harmony book.
The real test is a human one. Read or play a number
of songs by some second-rate composer—Gounod, for
instance. Then take up Brahms’ songs. By the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
you have done thirty or forty by Gounod you are
deathly sick of the same harmonies, the same melodic
phrases, the same way of placing the parts. In Brahms’
songs you will never be allowed to sleep; you are never
sure that the conventional thing is coming next. Your
interest is not allowed to flag. Brahms is almost never
commonplace. But this does not mean that he obviously
avoids the obvious, as is the fashion among lesser
composers of modern times. It means that his musicianship
is so rich and resourceful that he can always
find some fitting thing to do that a minor composer
would not have thought of. Test out this statement with
some concrete instance. Take one of the simplest of
Brahms’ melodies—the famous cradle song, opus 49.
No tune could be simpler. Any second-rate composer
would have supplied it with a conventional accompaniment
of bass and treble chords. Most composers would
have regarded such a song as a trifle to be tossed off
before breakfast. But it is evident that Brahms bestows
as much care upon this as upon his most elaborate
lyric. There is not a single unusual or strained chord
in the accompaniment. Yet there is not a measure
without its elements of variety and interest. The gentle
syncopation, as of the rocking of the cradle, is always
present; always shows some motion and variety.
Yet the whole song is managed without any straining
for effect, without letting the varied accompaniment
overshadow the simple melody.</p>

<p>Brahms has carried into his romantic song-writing
a classic regard for form. In the more general sense
this means that he always observed artistic proportion,
giving unity and body to his melodies, and curbing the
exuberant imagination which in so many song-writers
makes the parts attempt to be more important than
the whole. Concretely considered, we find that Brahms
nearly always held to the strophic form, seeing his
poems as stanzas which could be set to the same melody.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
In some cases, as in his first song, ‘Faithfulness,’
he treated the last strophe somewhat differently from
the others. A few of his songs are <em>durchkomponiert</em>,
after the manner of Schubert. But in general he felt
his songs to be far more musical architecture and less
mere running comment on the words. Certainly every
one of his songs would be a satisfactory piece of pure
music, apart from the text and apart from the special
meaning conveyed. His regard for form makes this
possible. Sometimes the form is hard to analyze, not
coinciding with any set formula, but the sense of form,
of architecture, of proportion, of restraint is always
there. Some have said that Brahms’ songs are mere
instrumental compositions with words added. As a
final criticism this is certainly unjust. But it has a certain
superficial justification, for Brahms certainly had
less regard for the words themselves than any other
great song-writer. He is not unwilling to force the text
into the form necessary to fit the music. Sometimes
he consistently and deliberately misplaces accents, as
in the first line of the song, <em>Wie bist du, meine Königin</em>,
which with Brahms’ music reads, ‘<em>Wie</em> bist du, <em>mei</em>ne
Köni<em>gin</em>.’ He is very free with slurred notes and shows
not the slightest hesitation in putting two notes to one
syllable in measure after measure. The music has
its own architecture, derived from formal or melodic
considerations and not from considerations of the text.
Of course, this is not the result of carelessness on
Brahms’ part, nor a belittling of the importance of the
words. It was merely that Brahms regarded his songs
as interpretive music, and not as ‘heightened speech.’
In this he differed from nearly every great song-writer,
and put himself in opposition to the taste of the time.
For those who feel Schumann’s scrupulous regard for
the text this will rank as a fault, a blot on the beauty
of Brahms’ songs. The student should decide the matter
for himself. At any rate, the fact points to the peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
interpretation which Brahms’ songs demand—an
interpretation which involves firm, reserved, controlled
modelling rather than minute emphasis on the
parts. Out of this regard for the design as a whole
rather than from the direct meaning of the details
will come the interpretive truth of the song.</p>

<p>Because Brahms’ songs represent the purely musical
and formal, as well as the interpretive, they are one of
the most valuable of studies for the advanced pupil.
A singer’s art cannot be complete as long as the effective
interpretation of Brahms’ songs remains a mystery
to him. Not to attempt to understand and love them,
because of the myth of dullness, is a sin against artistic
open-mindedness which no music-lover should be guilty
of. Indeed, if we can manage to escape for a time in
our souls from the trend of the time toward the spectacular,
the sensuous and the sensual, the easy and
effective, we shall find in Brahms a song-writer like
no other who ever lived, save only Schubert. Brahms
has treated almost every kind of sentiment and emotion
successfully. His melodies are lovely in the extreme,
his accompaniments are an endless delight to the careful
pianist; his musical procedure is never conventional
yet always appropriate; his music has a wholesomeness
and dignity unsurpassed in all song literature.
Other song-writers surpass Brahms in certain
qualities. But it is doubtful if any, except Schubert,
can be regarded as his equal in the combining of such
a large number of first-rate qualities and in the quantity
of first-rate songs produced.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>We may conveniently divide the Brahms songs into
two classes—the ‘folk-songs,’ written usually to anonymous
popular poems and preserving the simplicity and
directness of the true folk-song; and the art-songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
which make use of all the resources of elaboration
and organization at the command of that master craftsman.
Some of the opus numbers contain ‘folk-songs’
entirely or in large proportion. (Brahms wrote but one
cycle in the strict sense, and usually followed no scheme
of grouping.) But a folk-like song may appear anywhere
in his song output. The type of folk-feeling in
Brahms is almost exclusively German. There is
scarcely the slightest attempt at ‘local color’ in the
whole of Brahms’ music. Even the Gypsy songs, though
they somehow attain an exotic flavor, make use of none
of the conventional musical formulas of Hungarian
music. Moreover, while the ‘folk-songs’ are distinctly
German, they are also distinctly Brahms. The composer
never lost his individuality in any single work.
The accompaniments to these songs are usually simple,
but they are never merely conventional. They show
a nice adaptation of the style of the piano part to the
character of the melody and of the song as a whole,
and continually present unobtrusive elements of interest
in detail.</p>

<p>These ‘folk-songs’ are numerous. From opus 7 we
may select two very beautiful songs for special mention—namely,
the <em>Volkslied</em> and ‘The Mournful One,’
the latter one of Brahms’ finest expressive melodies.
Opus 14 is a treasure. ‘Before the Window’ is a thing
of great beauty. ‘Going to My Sweetheart’ has a
humorous touch, which Brahms could get inimitably.
But it is very restrained; the melody is so very simple
that for a moment it seems almost trivial. The ‘Serenade’
and ‘Longing’ from the same group are delightful.
From opus 47 we should mention ‘Sunday’ and from
opus 48 ‘Joy Hath Left Me,’ a fine song in the style of
an old German chorale. In opus 69 are an exquisite
‘Lament’ and the delicious song, ‘The Lover’s Oath.’
‘The Maiden,’ in opus 95, is a dialogue between the girl
and the reflection of her face in the water. The words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
are a Servian popular poem and the music is in an
irregular metre which is peculiar to the Slavic races.
Brahms’ last group of lyrics, the Gypsy Songs, opus
103, are beyond all praise. These eight songs, written
when the composer was past middle age, have all the
fire and ardor of early youth just awakened to its powers.
There is in them a frenzy of animal spirits which
befits their Gypsy words. In them we seem to hear the
message of that fine Hungarian song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>‘Brechen muss das Herz vor freude oder Leid;<br>
Das allein heisst bei den Ungarn Fröhlichkeit.’</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Gypsy Songs, all in strophic form, are very short.
Into a few seconds of melody Brahms injects his musical
message. Not a note is wasted. The mood is carried
over with perfect accuracy and conviction. The
songs are all nicely contrasted. Each might be a tiny
movement from a symphony, <em>multum in parvo</em>. There
is an <em>allegro agitato</em>, an <em>allegretto</em>, an <em>allegro giocoso</em>, a
<em>vivace grazioso</em>, an <em>andantino grazioso</em>, and so on.
Each song has a very distinct ‘style,’ as modern critics
would say. The mood is established at the first note
and maintained until the last. The melodies themselves
are altogether charming. But a mere knowledge
of the melodies will not suggest the thrilling effect
which these songs make when well sung in a large hall.
The startling effectiveness of many of the Brahms songs
is the best answer to the charge that Brahms is academic
and pedantic. It is hard to select any best out
of these eight songs. ‘The Nut Brown Lad’ is perhaps
the most popular of them, but the charm of each is so
distinct that a comparison is difficult. ‘Three Roses in
a Row’ is a delicate melody of great beauty. The vigorous
‘Hey, Ye Gypsies!’ and the furious ‘Red Evening
Clouds’ which closes the series, are overflowing with
animal spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>Of the pieces which are more specifically art-songs
we must admit a gradual change in character corresponding
to the general change in Brahms’ music from
the ‘romantic’ to the ‘classic.’ Of course, this change
has been overemphasized in superficial Brahms criticism.
It was not so much Brahms who changed; it was
the lay of the land. Music became much more sensuous
and free and formless. Brahms became still more
himself. The revolutionary Brahms of 1850 was a conservative
Brahms in 1880. But, undoubtedly, where
Schumann expected him to look forward, Brahms chose
in many things to look backward—or, rather, perhaps,
to look inward. And so we feel in Brahms’ music as
a whole that it becomes stranger and more reserved
as the man matures. He became more interested in
the things that had ceased to interest the rabble, and
less interested in the things which scores of new and
radical composers were beginning to do very well.
And we can feel this change in his songs. The earliest
ones—in opus 3—are filled with the joy of spontaneous
creation. The so-called ‘classic’ virtues seemed the last
things the composer was thinking about. But the songs
were in a pretty strict strophic form and their intelligence
was at least equal to their exuberance. And it
was these formal and intellectual qualities, and not the
others, which were to receive the chief emphasis and
intensification as the composer matured. To Schumann,
Brahms was the continuer of Schumann. To
the world he became the continuer of Beethoven.</p>

<p>The songs of opus 3 are filled with physical energy.
‘Fidelity,’ the first of them, with its accompaniment of
throbbing triplets, seems to tap some hidden source of
power like a huge dynamo. We cannot see the source
but we know there is much more where that came from.
‘Love and Spring’ suggests certain of the later Brahms
qualities and the song from ‘Ivan’ seems like a shooting
arrow in the vigor and directness of its expression.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
The same physical energy is shown in the ‘Spanish
Song,’ in bolero tempo, in opus 6; and the peculiarly
rich Brahms modulation is again revealed in ‘As the
Clouds.’ The ‘Nightingale’ song from the same group
is the first to foreshadow the increased technical elaboration
which Brahms was later to give his accompaniments.
Here the fluttering triplets in the piano are
meant to suggest the winging of the birds, but it is easy
to see that the purely technical problem which they
created had fascinated the composer. And, except for
this technical care, such an accompaniment would have
overbalanced the melody. The <em>Anklänge</em> of opus 7
has an elaborate syncopated accompaniment which
shows the continuation of the technical concern; ‘The
Return,’ from the same series, is another example of
Brahms’ unsurpassed power to pour great energy into
small compass. In opus 19 there are two more songs
of the highest quality. One is ‘The Smith,’ to Uhland’s
words, perhaps the shortest of all Brahms’ songs and
certainly one of the most overwhelmingly effective.
The maiden who speaks in Uhland’s delicious poem
tells admiringly of her lover, who is a smith and who
works all day amid the grime and the sparks. The
melody, with that strange and very Brahmsian avoidance
of the regular balancing of phrases which seems
physically to condense great energy in a small compass,
seems a succession of hammer blows. Each note
has a ponderous weight of its own, but a weight which
is followed by a fine rebound. The accompaniment,
which is obviously intended to suggest flying sparks, is
magically adapted to the peculiarities of the pianoforte.
The short postlude, and, indeed, the whole of the accompaniment,
is strikingly Wagnerian, recalling very
closely the Valkyrie’s cry in <em>Die Walküre</em>. Such a detail
is only one more proof of the foolishness of the artificial
rivalry which stupid critics set up between Wagner
and Brahms. The two men were great artists working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
in very different lines. As for their musical ideas,
they could almost, at times, have been interchanged.
The second remarkable song of opus 19 is the ‘Æolian
Harp,’ one of the three or four most admired of all
Brahms’ lyrics. This is one of the few that are in quite
free form. It is almost a <em>scena</em> rather than a song, since
it opens with a recitative and is interrupted in the middle
with free declamation. The Æolian harp sings in
the west wind the lament of a Greek boy who had been
taken to a distant land. Here Brahms’ marvellously
colored harmonies have created a peculiar beauty
which quite escapes analysis.</p>

<p>As we come to the more mature work we find the
mere animal spirits less frequently in the foreground.
We feel more and more the qualities of control and
dominant intellectuality. Not that these songs are better
than their predecessors, for some of the earliest
ones are finished masterpieces which could hardly be
improved. Nor (let it be repeated) does Brahms’ fund
of musical ideas become less fresh or less charming.
But the composer had begun to show at their best the
qualities which have chiefly given him a place in modern
music. The second song of opus 32 is a triumphant
justification of this mature Brahms. The song is entitled
only with a number, but it can be known by its
first line, <em>Nicht mehr zu dir zu gehen!</em> Here is intellectuality
in song writing at its best. Brahms never
wrote a finer song; few composers, if any, have done so.
Its popularity may always be limited, but it is surely
one of the great songs of musical literature. Here, as
nowhere else, Brahms has observed the rhythmic and
quantitative values of his text to the last letter. The
words, which are in a moody, reflective vein, are treated
almost in declamatory fashion. Every rise or fall of
the voice finds its expression in the melodic line of the
voice part. The tempo is a slow 3/2, and through this
winds the melody, now breaking off suddenly, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
though gasping for breath, now rising sharply, as
though choked with pain. If it were pure declamation,
it could not be more faithful to the words; if it were
pure melody, it could not be more faithful to the spirit.
The accompaniment, answering the voice part simply
but intensely, and providing a noble bass for the musical
texture to be woven upon, shows Brahms’ finest
qualities of restraint and perfect fitness. Here is a song
which is never exhausted. Let the student play and
sing it every day, it will still have something to teach
him. Hardly less noble is another song in the same
group, <em>So steh’n wir, ich und meine Weide</em>. Its theme
has all the dignity of a great andante fugue subject by
Bach. The treatment of the piano part, with its definite
melody in the bass forming an answer and a sort of
canon with the voice, is superb. We may also mention
in this opus number the much overrated song,
<em>Wie bist du meine Königin</em>, a piece which has doubtless
gained its popularity by its passionate fervor, but which
in musical beauty and artistic fitness is far inferior to
Brahms’ best work.</p>

<p>Opus 33 comprises a large number of romances from
L. Tieck’s <em>Magelone</em>. These songs, which incline to be
long and somewhat pretentious, do not maintain the
high standard usual with Brahms. There are here
rather too much sound and fury. We may, however,
mention three which are very fine: ‘Hey, Bow and Arrow,’
a song made of fire and steel; ‘Is It Sorrow?’
deeply emotional; and the lovely ‘Rest, Sweet Love.’
From now on we have merely a steady stream of songs
with words garnered from here and there, the music of
a very high standard of workmanship and the interest
often hidden to the superficial glance. Each song has its
individuality which must be sought out by the student.
A commentary on all the songs would fill many pages.
In opus 43 we find the fine song, ‘With Eternal Love,’
and the barbaric ballad, ‘The Song of Herr von Falkenstein.’
Such intentional crudity as Brahms puts into
this latter song should redeem him from any suspicion
of pedantry. The ‘Magyar Love Song’ of opus 46 treats
the words with unusual freedom even for Brahms. The
same can be said for ‘Gold Outweighs Love,’ in opus
48. Opus 49 offers us an interesting song, ‘On Sunday
Morning,’ and the famous Lullaby. In opus 57 we
have ‘Motionless Air,’ and in opus 58 ‘Oh, Come, Holy
Summer Night,’ both fine enough to be the masterpieces
of another man’s output, though they are Brahms’ second
best. ‘Twilight Falls,’ of opus 59, is a deeply tragic
piece in the folk-mood. In opus 63 we have one song
which shows us Brahms as the most thorough technician.
The ‘Consolation of Spring’ makes the most
elaborate use of syncopation and mixed rhythms, accompanying
the 6/4 voice part with a piano part practically
in 3/2. ‘Remembrance,’ from the same group, is
worth knowing, and ‘O, Would I Knew the Returning
Road’ is one of the sweetest of Brahms’ songs.</p>

<p>In opus 66 is one of the daintiest and most humorous
of the songs, a duet to folk-words, which might be sung
as a solo—‘Have a Care.’ ‘I Call from the Bank,’ in
opus 69, is Brahms once more in the generous world
of romance. ‘The Maiden’s Curse,’ in the same group,
is a fine tragic song set to a Servian folk-poem. It is
an interesting question here whether Brahms did not
fail entirely to catch the spirit of the words. The
maiden, in a dialogue with her mother, curses her lover,
who has prevented her from finishing the washing.
She hopes he may be hanged (upon her white breast),
chained (in her white arms), drowned (in her love),
and so on. The point of the song is the double meaning
of the curses. Brahms has treated the words as the
passionate rhetoric of love. But it is probable that the
poem, in its true spirit, is a comic song. The second
part of each curse should probably be delivered <em>sotto
voce</em>, so that the mother shall not hear. In such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
reading there would be a delightful comic contrast between
the coarse hussy which the girl pretends to be
and the sentimental love-sick maiden that she is.
Brahms makes no sort of distinction between the two
parts of the curses and the song in his hands attains a
certain tragic intensity by virtue of the girl’s defiance
of her mother.</p>

<p>In opus 71 are ‘To the Moon’ and the <em>Minnelied</em>, one
of the most admired of Brahms’ songs. In sheer
beauty, however, this is inferior to the lovely lyric in
opus 72, <em>O, kühler Wald</em>. Opus 84 contains Brahms’
most spirited comic song, the delightful ‘Vain Serenade,’
the high spirits of which make it an irresistible
concert number. Two fine folk-songs are to be found
in opus 85, a Servian ‘Maiden’s song,’ and <em>Ade</em>, from
the Bohemian. Opus 94 contains the famous ‘Sapphic
Ode.’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Here we find, in the simple melody (as apart
from the song as a whole), Brahms’ intellectuality and
sensuous beauty fused into a perfect whole. Over it all
is that fine artistic reserve which Brahms was so master
of and which makes the music so fitting an expression
of Greek verse. Among others of the later songs
we should mention two Heine songs, ‘Death Is the Cool
Night’ and the ‘Sea Journey.’</p>

<p>Brahms’ songs are as permanent a part of concert
programs as those of Schubert or Franz. If they are
not as popular in the looser sense of the word, it is
because concert audiences are not yet as a whole willing
to give the necessary attention to them. For, while
the Brahms songs are emphatically not dull, they do
demand careful listening. Without doubt their popularity
will grow steadily. And this will be the best
of events both for audiences and for singers. He who
has learned to listen to Brahms’ songs will never again
be quite so indulgent with what is cheap and facile.
And the singer who has learned how to make effective
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>the striking qualities hidden in a Brahms song will find
himself equipped with a power and dignity in his work
which he could hardly get in any other way.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Wagner’s songs are few. They comprise only those
written during his early years in Paris, when for a time
he hoped to make himself a fashion in Parisian drawing
rooms, and those written under the influence of
Mathilde Wesendonck in the late fifties, when he was
planning ‘Tristan.’ The former group, being composed
at the time when he was writing ‘The Flying Dutchman’
and being, moreover, designed for a debased public
taste, can by no means be ranked with his typical
work. The songs it contains are not great. But Wagner’s
genius was too imperative to blot itself out at any
time and these early lyrics show evidences of the artistic
energy which was later to flower in ‘The Ring.’ The
earliest known of Wagner’s songs is ‘The Fir Tree,’ written
in 1838 in Königsberg. It has little more than historic
interest. In Paris he wrote the ‘Three Melodies,’
which are still occasionally sung and will repay a little
study. The lullaby, <em>Dors, mon enfant</em>, is marked with
a suavity in the melody and a variety in the accompaniment
which betray with certainty the touch of the true
musician. The second ‘melody,’ called ‘The Rose,’ is
rather too sweet but is saved by its interesting accompaniment.
‘Waiting’ is vigorous in conception and execution.
But the best of Wagner’s Parisian songs is
‘The Two Grenadiers,’ composed to a French version
of Heine’s famous poem, to which Schumann wrote
his popular setting. Wagner’s method is more dramatic
than Schumann’s. It gives a much more important
function to the accompaniment, which is something
approaching the ‘orchestral comment’ of his later theories.
At times the voice part is freely declamatory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
Throughout it is kept remarkably free from the running
comment of the piano. The long crescendo up to the
final lines is managed with skill. For these lines the
Marseillaise is used, as in Schumann’s setting, but only
in the accompaniment, the voice singing an independent
part. Here we have something approaching a true <em>leit
motif</em> used in a way foreshadowing the later revolutionary
music dramas. The introduction of the Marseillaise
by both Schumann and Wagner must be regarded
purely as a coincidence, since the songs, as it happens,
were written in the same year.</p>

<p>The ‘Five Poems,’ to words by Mathilde Wesendonck,
are, with one exception, songs of the first rank. This
exception is the ‘Sorrows,’ which is a bit pompous and
rings insincere. ‘The Angel’ is a simple melody with a
soft, flowing accompaniment much in the style of the
‘Lohengrin’ music. ‘Stand Still’ is a vigorous and dramatic
song, combining both the lyrical and the declamatory
elements. The two remaining songs will always
be masterpieces of the first order. They are regarded
as ‘studies’ for the Tristan music and both contain motives
from ‘Tristan’ or harmonic peculiarities which
mark them out unmistakably. <em>Träume</em> (‘Dreams’), the
better known of the two, weaves a wonderful sensuous
spell about the listener. Its melody is constructed in
a peculiar manner which we sometimes meet in Brahms—a
sort of telescoping of successive phrases, so as to
bind the parts more cogently and increase the emphasis
of the whole. The harmony is a wonderful series of
melting chords, culminating in ecstatic chromatic
modulations on the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>‘Sanft an deiner Brust verglühen<br>
Und dann sinken in die Gruft.’</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The other ‘Tristan’ song is <em>Im Treibhaus</em> (‘In the Hothouse’).
It contains two of the ‘Tristan’ motives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
slightly altered, those of the wounded Tristan and Tristan’s
longing. The harmony in this song is exceedingly
delicate and chromatic—revolutionary for its time.
Here the chromatic development toward which composers
had half consciously striven for two centuries
at last attained a complete development. The lyric
must rank as one of the wonders of modern song literature.</p>

<p>Liszt’s songs also we may roughly divide into two
classes—those of the Paris period and those of the
Weimar period. More than Wagner, Liszt wrote his
French songs in the taste of the time and the nation.
As one of the pets of the capital he was sure to be
heard gladly by the Parisians and his wonderful instinct
for pleasing made him write naturally in a style
which we cannot usually differentiate from the style
of native song writers. <em>Comment!</em> for instance, is as
French a song as though its composer had never travelled
beyond the Parisian fortifications. Its sensitive
feeling for the words, its delicate use of the accompaniment
in the thin French style, mark it as utterly un-German.
The most striking of the Parisian songs is
<em>Enfant, so j’étais roi</em>, to words by Victor Hugo. It is
elaborate and pretentious, but it has a good deal of real
power. On the whole, however, Liszt’s French songs
are without the very qualities which make the later
German songs so valuable—chiefly the dramatic and
the declamatory values.</p>

<p>Not all these German songs are of high rank, though
we may select a dozen or so which are the work of
genius. The cheapness which so often entered into
the rest of Liszt’s work, finds its way now and then into
the songs, but on the whole this department of his creative
activity maintains a higher average than any other.
Cheapness enters somewhat into two of the earlier German
songs, ‘The Fisher Boy’ and ‘The Shepherd,’ both
to words by Schiller. The accompaniments are graphically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
descriptive. Caring little for the formal unity of
the songs, Liszt introduced the description suggested
by the words whenever the suggestion came. In fact,
the songs are really declamations for the voice with
a running comment in the piano. They are far superior
to the longer declamatory songs of Schubert, which
were little more than pretentious recitatives; they raise
the declamation into real melody and the descriptive
comment into real music. But these songs are far surpassed
by some of the Weimar period. ‘The Loreley,’
to Heine’s words, is one of the most elaborate descriptive
songs ever written. The opening lines are freely
declaimed to a suggestive accompaniment. When the
description of the Rhine enters—<em>die Luft ist kühl und
es dunkelt</em>—we hear a lovely 9/8 motive set over an
arpeggio accompaniment which strikingly suggests the
calm flowing river. The music becomes deeper and
richer as the Loreley enters the action. The passage
where the fisher is dragged into the depths of the water
is treated with free and impressive dramatic power.
Then the Rhine once more flows quietly over the place
where the man was drowned and the lovely river theme
returns once more, deepening into silence as the darkness
falls. This song illustrates almost at its best the
principle of the descriptive song, the principle held by
many that the effect of <em>the whole</em> is to be gained by
treating <em>each part</em> with fidelity. It is interesting to
compare this setting with the simple folk-like setting
provided by Silcher and universally sung. The latter
makes a very regular strophic melody serve for all the
stanzas. The two settings are both wonderful and in
very different ways. A choice between the two must be
a matter of individual taste. It will be a nice exercise
for the student to study the two and choose, on personal
grounds, between them.</p>

<p>Fine as ‘The Loreley’ is, Liszt has written two ballads
which are finer. His setting of ‘The King of Thule,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
from Goethe’s ‘Faust,’ is almost beyond praise. In this
he uses a brief suggestive phrase in the accompaniment
which becomes the germ of the whole ballad, being
repeated in many connotations and moods. ‘The Ancestral
Tomb,’ to Uhland’s words, perhaps suffers just
a trifle from the pompous, but is nevertheless one of
the best ballads (or, more properly, romances) that we
have. The old warrior, the last of his race, goes to his
ancestral tomb, in which one stone vault is still empty.
He hears the voices of his fathers singing an impressive
and mysterious song of family pride. The voices cease
and he lays himself in the empty vault and dies. Suggestions
of unguessed mystery and grandeur hang over
the ballad.</p>

<p>In addition to these larger compositions, Liszt
achieved what might reasonably have been considered
an impossibility for him—the pure lyric. Some of his
settings are almost flawless. Heine’s <em>Du bist wie eine
Blume</em> has never received such fine music at the hands
of another composer. The opening and typical phrase
seems to contain the essence of the religious sentimentalism
of Heine’s words. ‘Mignon’s Song’ commences
with a phrase, set over an altered chord, which has
become famous for its accurate delineation of a mood
in a few notes. Perhaps the most impressive of his
brief lyrics is <em>Der du von dem Himmel bist</em>. Liszt’s
simple setting of this poem is finer, if possible, than
Schubert’s. <em>Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam</em> and <em>Im
Rhein, im schönen Strome</em> present many elements of
beauty and interest. But the most typical and possibly
the finest of all Liszt’s songs is ‘The Three Gypsies,’ to
Lehnau’s words. In the poem the speaker tells of having
passed along a country road and having seen three
gypsies, one smoking, one fiddling, and one sleeping.
In the music each of the gypsies is carefully differentiated.
The characterization in this song is beyond all
praise. The voice part is an eloquent declamation, rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
here and there into inspired melody. For the basic
theme, the theme of the joy of life, Liszt has a magnificent
Hungarian melody, surely one of the finest he ever
used. The song is one of the most effective of concert
pieces.</p>

<p>In spite of his comparatively small output, Liszt’s
songs are of great importance in the history of song
writing. He, better than any other, fused the declamatory
and the lyrical—truth to the words and truth to
the emotions. He several times struck the grand note
as few purely lyrical composers (not even Schubert)
have been able to do. In the development of the piano
part along the purely descriptive side no composer has
gone beyond Liszt.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Every great burst of genius in any department of
art is followed by widespread imitation. The genius
(the <em>seer</em>, as Carlyle calls him) <em>sees</em> his way to new objects
and achievements which lesser men are blind to.
Before the genius has done the thing, the thing seems
impossible; after he has done it, it seems divinely simple.
The genius seems to have taught people how.
Every second-rate talent can now follow the formula
and produce the same results. Of course, the second-rate
talent cannot produce <em>quite</em> the same results, easy
as it may seem. But the first-rate talent (and geniuses
following) can produce fine results and can even produce
results that are more thorough and more refined,
because they are building upon the work of genius. So
the impulse spreads. Many men take up the work that
had formerly been the unique property of one. The
genius has done the pioneer work. The new department
of art is advertised by him, made popular, even
made profitable. Lesser men can get something like
the same results with less sacrifice, less effort. The
imitators, in turn, have their imitators. The great initial
impulse, as it spreads, also weakens. Fine strokes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
of genius are imitated until they become only formulas.
People are familiar with the style and are satisfied
with less convincing results than formerly. The art-form
may even become so codified and formulated that
first-rate men will become disgusted and refuse to give
their serious efforts to it. Then the small fry are left
in full possession of the field.</p>

<p>Something like this happened to song literature after
Schubert. Fortunately, song writing has continually,
since Schubert, attracted enough first-rate men to prevent
it from falling into a depraved state in all countries
at once. But the general course of song literature
since Schubert’s death has been that of diffusion and
dilution up nearly to the end of the century, when the
well-developed harmonic systems of the younger composers
poured new energy into the form. Throughout
the greater part of this time there were first-rate men
working—Schumann, Franz, Brahms, and others. But
there was also an increasingly great number of second-rate
men who wrote charming and artistic songs—songs
which we could by no means overlook. And
there was also an increasing number of inferior men
who gained great popularity on very slender artistic
resources. Many of these showed marked individuality,
exquisite finish of workmanship, and fine inspiring
ideas. They are by no means to be omitted from any
history of song. They cannot and should not be excluded
from concert programs. In some respects certain
of them have surpassed the great masters. It is
also true that excellent work, even first-class work,
may be produced in small quantities by men who have
scarcely any claim on fame. So any attempt, like the
attempt in this chapter, to list and describe the work
of a number of less important composers must exclude
certain workers in the field whose songs are of high
excellence. In such a chapter as this the warning must
always be given that the list is not all-inclusive. A man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
who is quite unknown may produce work equal almost
to the best. The student should, while keeping high
standards of judgment, regard any song as innocent
until it has proved itself guilty. He should always be
willing to recognize excellence; he should always be
honestly willing to express his liking for a particular
song, be it unknown or despised. Such a chapter as
this, we have said, is necessarily incomplete. The student
must, in the course of his study, complete it for
himself.</p>

<p>After the death of Schumann we see the art of song-writing
spreading to every European country which cultivated
music at all. Germany, in addition to Brahms,
Wagner, and Liszt, can show Cornelius, Jensen, and
Lassen among the most prominent. Scandinavia is represented
by Kjerulf and Grieg. The French have a long
line of well-known song writers, many of them scarcely
above the level of mediocrity and not one showing any
touch of first-rate talent. In Italy we see a slender
interest in song writing, which, however, produced a
rather large number of songs, some of much beauty.
Russia, in addition to the truly national composers
(who will be treated in another chapter), had distinguished
song writers in Rubinstein and Tschaikowsky.
England, still in a dry formalistic period, produced one
true romanticist of great talent—Arthur Goring-Thomas—and
several popular writers whose work shows
less distinction. And America (if we extend the period
slightly for the sake of convenience) shows one song
writer—Edward MacDowell—who ranks almost among
the greatest. Many of these composers rank now much
lower than they did in their lifetime. Others will likely
drop more and more out of sight as more recent work
becomes known. Tschaikowsky and Gounod, for instance,
have been much overrated in the past. A few
others, like Cornelius, are not so well known as they
deserve to be, and as they presently will be if heaven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
showers discrimination upon singers and concert audiences.
In any case, the values represented in this chapter
are largely values in transition. Even among these
composers, most of whom are dead, there are still reputations
to be made and lost.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Edvard Grieg (1843-1907) was essentially a writer in
the small forms. His ill health and also probably the
cast of his genius prevented him from undertaking
labors that called for great concentration and endurance.
But in the small forms he is one of the most
delightful of the romanticists of the second half of the
nineteenth century. He used harmonic color with telling
results. He was a master of rhythmic effects. In
particular he introduced into his music something of
the peculiar folk-idiom of his country (whether he did
it in conscious imitation of the folk-songs does not matter).
He was one of the first of the distinctly national
composers to become universally known and popular.
His melody is always engaging; the national peculiarities
of it are not so obtrusive or so unusual as to alienate
the ordinary listener. He is distinctly easy to enjoy.
He was highly successful in the creation of poetic effect,
in which he was helped by the provocative unusualness
of his idiom. In the musical painting of pictures,
in the suggestion of moods that have a sensuous tinge,
there were few of his contemporaries who can equal
him.</p>

<p>It is evident that such a man would be successful with
songs. And Grieg’s songs (there are only 146 of them)
are among the most delightful we have. Some critics
are glad to place him just below Schubert and Brahms.
Certainly he shows in his songs a spontaneity, an <em>élan</em>,
that is one of the prime qualities of the lyrical spirit.
Like Franz, he makes his songs brief and to the point.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
Unlike Franz, he takes considerable freedom of form
and outline and makes an easy appeal to an unsophisticated
public. As an interpreter of moods he is admirable.
But his songs have made their popularity
probably more on their sheer beauty than on any interpretative
quality.</p>

<p>In several of his ballads Grieg has caught a suggestion
of the archaic—a certain angularity of melody
which is crude yet beautiful. This is typified in ‘The
Princess,’ words by the Norwegian poet Björnsen; and
‘The Old Song,’ words by Heine. But in general Grieg
shows that he has little to add to the ballad or the
longer vocal forms. He is at his most typical, and possibly
at his best, in ‘The Swan,’<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> words by the dramatist
Ibsen. Here he is using harmonic color for all it will
yield. In style the song is as far as possible removed
from the work of Franz, for it consists simply of a
melody with chords for accompaniment. There is
scarcely a suggestion of the polyphonic style. The
chords, generally in a slightly unusual or altered form,
are simply juxtaposed. From their contrast comes the
color which is so marked in this song. No other composer,
before Grieg, had done this particular thing so
well and in point of originality the song can justly be
included among the great ones of the world. In <em>Ich
liebe dich</em>, which is far better known, he is in a vein
that is much less fine. Here there is nothing of the
national idiom. The song is indeed remarkable for
the manner in which it creates emotional excitement in
a mere four lines. But through it all there is something
of the vulgar. It is not a song apart, like ‘The Swan,’
but one of the horde.</p>

<p>We must grant it as one of Grieg’s distinctions that
his songs have a marked individuality and distinction,
one from the other, even though this distinction is more
superficial than essential. In general scheme, no two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>of his best songs are much alike. Each has a virtue
which is peculiar to it. In ‘Solvejg’s Song’ he writes
in a modal folk-style, charming, yet a little more sophisticated
than a folk-song would be. ‘Autumn Storm’ is
a good piece of emotional expression, though uneven.
‘The Minstrel’s Song’ shows dramatic power in a compressed
phrase. ‘The Youth’ is admirable in its management
of a declamation which is still melody. More
items of technical interest appear in ‘The Berry,’ ‘A
Fair Vision,’ and ‘My Goal.’ These, especially the last,
are all songs of a high order. In ‘My Goal’ we should
notice the vigor which is injected into the whole piece
by the composer’s harmonic freedom. The handling of
the piano part on the <em>fff</em> climax is especially typical
of Grieg. In ‘The Berry’ the accompaniment contains
a certain sort of free counterpoint, which becomes very
effective in the composer’s chromatic method of handling
it. ‘A Fair Vision’ (<em>Was sah ich</em>) makes much use
of picture drawing in the accompaniment, with its glittering
introduction and its delicious descending chromatic
voice in the bass. The chords of the middle section,
very Grieg-like in style, are particularly charming.
In ‘Friendship’ the composer uses unusual chords,
again, to express the feeling or the idea of unfaithfulness.
The listener will be struck by the likeness of this
song to Schubert’s <em>Doppelgänger</em>. ‘The Old Mother’ is
a simple and very beautiful song, more folk-like even
than is usual with Grieg. One of the most exquisite
of Grieg’s songs, from the standpoint of artistry and
taste, is ‘Hidden Love,’ a model of sensitive writing, in
which every note can be heard and every note is in
place. The deeply tragic note is not often sounded by
Grieg, but in ‘By the Bier of a Young Wife’ he has
achieved it superbly. This song is especially worth
study for the extreme freedom of its modulation. The
harmonic movement is so constant that there is scarcely
any feeling of a change from key to key, but rather a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
sense of moving about in a musical world that is without
tonality. The student should also notice the extremely
effective use of dissonance. Among the shorter
songs we should also notice ‘Solvejg’s Cradle Song’ and
the ‘Folk-song from Langeland.’</p>

<p>In the long song entitled ‘From Mount Pincio’ Grieg
the picture-painter is at his best. The poet stands on
the mount and sees Italy spread out before him. Nature
is in a mysterious and lovely mood. The peasants,
with their dancing, lend animation to the peaceful
scene. And the ancient Italy, the Italy of Rome, rises
to his mind. One feels that Liszt should have composed
this song, even though he might have made it over-pompous.
Grieg has chosen to ignore the suggestion of
ancient Italy in his music, using his old musical material
to express the new idea. Yet this conservatism
undoubtedly has the virtue of lending unity to the song,
which otherwise is flawless in point of taste. The mood
of mysterious nature Grieg has described best of all
in his cycle, ‘From Mountain and Fjord.’ The prologue
and epilogue of this group have a heroic grandeur
and yet a sympathetic intimacy which we feel
in great vistas of landscape. In the last number in particular
the flashes of grandeur seem at times supernatural.
In both these songs the declamatory style is
masterfully handled. The songs within this impressive
frame are short and folk-like and markedly in the
Grieg idiom. Indeed, the composer, among his unpretentious
songs, has written nothing more charming than
‘Ragnhild’ and ‘Ingebjorg.’</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Of the various song writers whom, for convenience,
we are here calling ‘minor,’ there is one who should not
be given the epithet without reservation. This is Peter
Cornelius (1824-1874), friend and disciple of Liszt and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
partisan of Wagner. The work of Cornelius has something
of the great strain in it. The man had a fine and
daring talent, if not positive genius. His work seems
somehow unfinished, without quite enough authority to
place him among the masters. It is as though he were
making sketches for Parnassus, but had died before attempting
the giant canvas. Perhaps he took up music
too late. He was a mature man with a profession before
he felt the influence of Liszt and devoted himself
wholly to composition. Though he was by no means
deficient in technical ability, one somehow feels that
fate had got a head-start of him—that the truly great
composer must become such in his cradle. But those
who will take the trouble to know him will find him
one of the most satisfactory of the less known German
composers. He responded to Liszt’s intense and generous
interest in music. He had the enthusiasm of the
amateur and the energy and thoroughness of the German
professional man. He was blessed with the open
mind which enabled him to fight for Wagner when the
latter was known in Germany only to be despised. He
had a keen artistic sense, together with a vigorous and
critical mentality which enabled him to use it with
much force. And he had what so few composers possess,
the breadth of culture and interest which comes
from knowing other subjects besides music intimately
and well. From his songs one gets the impression that
nearly all show originality and creative power, though
not many have the final stamp of authority to raise
them into a class with the great. From the creative
standpoint Cornelius’s songs are far superior to Jensen’s.
But, because he was unable to give his work the
same finish of style that Jensen gave to his, he is not,
like Jensen, a name known to every singer of songs.
Let us go to Cornelius chiefly for stimulation, leaving
in the background for the time our sense of form and
finish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>Many of Cornelius’s published songs are mainly experimental.
He seems to have written what he wrote
with much difficulty. It is doubtful if he was often
altogether satisfied with the work that left his composing
desk. The songs of the ‘Lord’s Prayer’ cycle, for
instance, are extremely interesting and impressive in
conception, but they nearly always fail in execution.
Out of the group only the ninth, ‘And Deliver Us from
Evil,’ is quite satisfactory. But the man’s imagination
is shown in what he evidently attempted to do in the
sixth, ‘And Forgive Us Our Debts,’ which has a fine
fugal bass. The third song of the series, ‘Thy Kingdom
Come,’ is probably next in interest. Of the other early
songs we may mention the ‘Shepherd’s Night-Song,’
‘In the Moonlight’ (a charming scherzo), the ‘Slumber
Song,’ and ‘Think’st Thou of Me?’ Of much beauty is
‘Come, Let Us Wander,’ which obtains a gently colored
‘atmosphere’ with the simplest of means. And among
the later songs there are three fine ones which should
be mentioned—‘On Molly’s Death,’ to one of Bürger’s
famous poems; <em>Auftrag</em> and <em>Abendgefühl</em>, the last probably
Cornelius’s best song.</p>

<p>A good part of his work is contained in song cycles,
namely: ‘Sorrow and Consolation,’ the ‘Rhine Songs,’
the ‘Christmas Songs,’ and the ‘Bridal Songs.’ In the
first of these, for which the composer wrote his own
words (he was a poet of much ability), we find three
songs which must rank high. These are: ‘From the
Quiet Spot,’ ‘Dreaming,’ and ‘A Tone.’ The second
would answer anyone’s doubts as to whether Cornelius
had the lyric gift. For he has given us here a song
which in its few measures can throw magic over our
souls. The best known of all his songs is ‘A Tone,’ in
which the voice part is carried entirely on one note,
while the accompaniment weaves lovely fabrics of
melody around it. This, the only song of its kind
which the writer is able to call to mind, might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
been a mere trick. We can imagine such a song being
written on a bet. But a few measures of ‘A Tone’ will
dispel any such notion. For the lyric is a work of art
throughout. The water-mark of the second-rate song
writer is not to be found in a single measure. Of the
‘Rhine Songs’ the best is the fourth, ‘Fancies.’ The
Christmas Songs are interesting for the composer’s attempt
to adapt them to children. The melodies, of the
utmost simplicity, have an ecclesiastical ring which
lends color to the sentiment. Of the six songs the best
is ‘Three Kings,’ but the whole group is worth knowing
for the peculiar vitality of their modal style. The
finest and most beautiful of the song cycles, however,
is the group known as ‘Bridal Songs.’ These <em>Brautlieder</em>,
the words written by the composer, seek to interpret
six various sentiments of a young girl at the
season of her marriage. They are wonderfully delicate
in sentiment and finished in execution. The opening
song, ‘A Myrtle Spray,’ is tender and appealing; the
third, <em>Vorabend</em>, is in Cornelius’s fine half declamatory
style; and the fourth, the ‘Morning Prayer,’ is a
deep and noble expression of religious sentiment, one
of the finest things the composer has achieved. In
these songs we can scarcely complain of lack of finish
and authority. These qualities they have, together with
inherent beauty and originality. If Cornelius could
have written a greater number of songs like the <em>Brautlieder</em>,
the <em>Auftrag</em>, and the <em>Abendgefühl</em> we should
surely be obliged to rank him among the ‘great’ song
writers. As it is, his work deserves far more general
recognition than it has received and we have reason
to expect that his fame will spread.</p>

<p>Adolph Jensen (1837-1879) was a much more finished
song-writer than Cornelius and a much less vital one.
His songs have gained much popularity among singers
because of their perfect taste, their fine sense of fitness
and perfection of form, and their ‘singability.’ Sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
he attains sheer beauty of no mean order. But
in the actual business of expression Jensen’s songs do
not often ring true. The composer is chiefly at home
with the lighter sentiments or with nature in her gentler
moods. Pierce much beneath the surface and the expression
is insincere. Undoubtedly there was in Jensen
a sensitive and genuine artistic nature. But it had
neither the robustness nor the spontaneity necessary
for the creation of a lyric literature. Jensen’s contribution,
if he has contributed anything, is a certain refinement
of outline. His songs sound much like other good
German songs, only rather more timid.</p>

<p>His very first published song, <em>Lehn’ deine Wang an
meine Wang</em>, is known wherever there are students of
singing. It has been universally admired for its simplicity
and touching sentiment. It has been highly
praised for its delicacy of workmanship. But, granted
that it was a masterpiece according to the standards
of its day, its day is past. Nowadays we are demanding
a more positive assertion, a more creative musicianship.
Jensen did far better than this in later songs.
Some of his vigorous lyrics are admirable, notably the
Bolero, ‘In the Shadow,’ ‘On the Bank of the River,’
and ‘Old Heidelberg,’ the last an excellent essay in
popular counterpoint. The formal often attains charming
results in Jensen’s songs, witness, ‘Mother, I Have
Two Little Eyes,’ which is a miniature symphony allegretto.
But on the whole it is in his nature-songs that
he is most at ease. The list of superior ones is rather
long—‘Murmuring Breezes,’ ‘Spring Night,’ and ‘Evening
Air’ are representative. The <em>Waldesgespräch</em> depends
more on pure melody in the voice than does
Schumann’s setting of the same words, and is in every
way an inferior song. The Scotch songs have their
charm, but are so empty of feeling compared with the
fine tunes to which the words are set in their native
country that their composition seems a sin. But
‘Sleep’st Thou, My Maiden?’ in which the folk-spirit is
purely German, is a charming song. The best of all,
however, is probably ‘Margarete at the Door.’</p>

</div>

<p>Eduard Lassen (1830-1904) was even less pretentious
than Jensen in his songs, but rather more genuine
and satisfactory. Possibly we cannot call him a true
interpreter of emotion, but we must credit him with the
composition of many a lovely melody. Lassen was
Liszt’s successor in the directorship at Weimar and thus
lived in a stimulating atmosphere. His songs, which
were probably the outcome of moments of play, rather
than serious efforts, show both more buoyancy and
more elasticity than do those of Jensen. With them we
are again breathing the fresh air, albeit a peaceful air.
Many of his songs content themselves with being simple
strophic melodies, interpretive only in general mood
and not in detail. The best loved of his songs, ‘Thine
Eyes So Blue and Tender,’ is fairly typical of the simpler
ones. Lassen’s setting of Heine’s ‘It Was a Dream’
is more truly an art-song, though its appeal is gained
by the simplest of means. ‘Whither’ has an arpeggio
accompaniment which adds admirably to the simple
freshness of the song. ‘Spring’ is furnished forth with
interesting modulations, managed with unfailing taste.
In ‘Thou Fairest Vision’ Lassen becomes vigorous and
passionate; in ‘The Sun’s Bright Beams’ he attains
dignity and breadth within brief space. In considering
Lassen’s lyrical and melodic style it should be interesting
for the reader to compare his settings of Heine with
Schumann’s—as, for instance, in ‘It was a Dream,’ <em>Ein
Fichtenbaum steht einsam</em>, and <em>Ich hab’ im Traum
geweinet</em>. On the whole, though Lassen struck out no
new path in song writing, though he enlarged no boundaries
and tapped no new fields of expression, he kept
his songs on a high plane of artistic genuineness.
Among the song composers of the last half of the century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
who expressed themselves chiefly by means of melody,
Lassen is one of the most notable.</p>

<p>Georg Henschel (born Breslau 1850) is a song writer
whose present reputation is very far from equalling
the high standard of his work. This is perhaps because
his songs as a whole show no striking element of novelty.
But it is none the less regrettable. For in point
of pure merit Henschel must be ranked among the finest
song writers of his time. Born and educated in
Germany, he has spent most of the working years of
his life in America and England, where he has made
a notable reputation as singer and conductor. His
musicianship is solid and deep, his inspiration fresh
and unhackneyed, his method honest and straightforward.
He is purely German. In his songs we feel the
best traditions of the best song writers, concentrated
and amalgamated, but without any element of crass imitation.
His songs have the artistic finish which is necessary
to give conviction to any lyric work. In mood
they vary greatly from that of natural grandeur and
religious dignity all the way to the most delicate sentiment
and humor. Each of the songs is nicely individualized,
both in the musical themes and in the manner of
treatment. In them one is often reminded of Schumann,
but the solid musicianship of Brahms is equally
evident. There are no slipshod songs in his list and
few which do not stand on a high artistic level. The
accompaniment is rich, but on the whole conservative,
acting essentially as a support to the voice, however
richly decorated it may be. The general method is
strictly lyrical and melodic. Pure declamation enters
seldom. The dramatic and the picturesque elements
are present, but subordinated to the lyrical. Schumann’s
influence is continually evident, but Brahms,
too, is there with his solid and careful musicianship.
Further, we must place Henschel as one of the great
masters of the folk-spirit in art-song. His naïveté is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
not studied; it springs from a human sympathy with
the fundamental things in music. We have repeatedly
mentioned in this book the great test of the song writer,
namely that he shall be able to express emotional
states in a few notes; by this test Henschel is among
the most genuine of lyricists.</p>

<p>Henschel’s songs have been published in small groups
throughout his period of activity. Many of the groups
are in the nature of suites, or at least have some element
of unity. We may mention the ‘Forest Flowers
of Thuringia,’ opera 22 and 24; the six songs, <em>Im Volkston</em>,
opus 29; the <em>Serbisches Liederspiel</em>, opus 32, comprising
ten songs in a close cycle; the four songs to
poems by Hafiz, opus 34; and the three songs from
Kingsley’s ‘Water Babies,’ opus 36. Opera 22, 24, 29,
and 32 are all largely in the folk-manner and comprise
some of Henschel’s best. In addition to these and
numerous independent songs there are a number of
ballads, some of them furnished with orchestral accompaniment
which are among the best examples of
this difficult modern form.</p>

<p>The various songs in folk-manner offer a fine study
in musical taste and understanding. In the best of
them the peculiarities of each text have been caught
with such accuracy that any other musical interpretation
seems impossible. Examine, for instance, the two
‘Love Laments of a Maiden’—the long, crawling, saga-like
melodic line of the first, the dignified chorale form
of the second. Both are impeccable in point of metre
and word-accent. But the utter contrast in musical
style shows Henschel’s fine discrimination in his treatments
of his texts. He catches not merely the external
characteristics, but the innermost meaning of each of
his poems. Thus when he sets that tiny folk-masterpiece,
<em>Wenn du bei meinem Schätzel kommst</em>, he suggests
in his music the varying mood of the lines, but he
keeps the song far away from the delineative, showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
in his folk-like treatment of it that he regarded the
poem primarily as a unit—as a <em>single</em> play of wit. Songs
like <em>Verstohlen geht der Mond auf</em> and ‘Ladybird’
seem quite perfect examples of delicate and graceful
song writing. <em>Mei Schätzerl</em> is a humorous song which
is hardly surpassed by Brahms or Wolf. Another song
that is in every way a masterpiece is ‘The Miller’s Farewell,’
a melody purely in the folk-character, with a
subtle pathos verging on tragedy. <em>Der Holdseligen</em>,
one of the best of all his songs, is of a different sort.
It is essentially an art-song, though at first glance it
seems to bear the cachet of the folk. It is not a whit
more difficult or complicated than any of the folk-songs,
but there is in it somewhere that element of
conscious design that makes the difference. A study
of this song and one or two of Henschel’s pure folk-songs,
such as <em>Mund und Auge</em>, will reveal much concerning
the sensitive deftness of his art. In the more
pretentious art-song Henschel is just as much the master.
His ‘Morning Hymn,’ perhaps his best known song,
is of a grandeur rarely to be met with outside of Hugo
Wolf. Indeed, in the deeper emotions Henschel is seldom
found wanting. His themes are truthful and convincing;
his development clear and strong; his musicianship
fertile and resourceful.</p>

<p>Among the minor German song writers Alexander
von Fielitz (born 1860) has achieved unusual popularity.
He is best known by his cycle, <em>Eliland</em>, which is,
by all odds, his best work. The story of the monk’s
hopeless love is in itself a groundwork of extraordinary
sentimental appeal. Von Fielitz has thrown himself
into his task with great sympathy. All the songs
are of marked musical value. When sung together,
they reveal many lights and shades of rare poetical
charm. Here von Fielitz is a convincing interpreter of
the emotions. In his other songs he rarely strikes the
same level. His themes frequently have no marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
character and his technique is lacking in resource.
Often a mannerism of another composer—Schumann
or Wagner—is introduced in a rather obvious way. In
short, von Fielitz has hurt his reputation by writing
too much and repeating himself too often. In <em>Das
grüne, lustige Waldgezelt</em> he is fresh and spirited
and uses with effect his somewhat manneristic contrasting
voices in the accompaniment. The <em>Mädchenlieder</em>,
to words by Geibel, are delicate and very singable.
The Jester Songs, to words by Otto Julius Bierbaum,
are fairly interesting; the best being ‘The Melancholy
Fool.’ Among the best of his songs are <em>Nachruf</em>,
with its stimulating inner voices, and <em>Wehmuth</em>,
which is an excellent study in emotional climax. His
settings of the Tuscan Popular Poems by Gregorovius
and of the Modern Greek Folk-songs by Geibel often
show marked grace and charm. But on the whole we
search in vain in his songs for the genius-touch that
proclaims the master.</p>

<p>An early song writer of Norway, who, because of
the character of his work, can properly be named here,
is Halfdan Kjerulf (1818-1868). He was not of the line
of Schubert. His songs, which are very numerous, content
themselves with a vague sentimental charm. But
though he did nothing to advance the art-song, the man
was an artist. His melodies have had great popularity
and are perhaps known better to the man in the street
than to the professional singer. His ‘Last Night’ has
become a folk-song the world over. From the artistic
point of view the ‘Love Sermon’ is perhaps the best.
‘Synnöve’s Song’ and ‘Little Uenevil’ have all the genuineness
of the folk-song and all the sureness of the
art-song, a combination which many a composer might
envy. ‘The Mother at the Cradle’ is a touching melody,
with a delicate second melody in the accompaniment.
‘I Journeyed over the Sea’ is a fine ballad, simple and
genuine, and <em>Abendstimmung</em> and ‘God Knows where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
He Wanders’ are songs well worth knowing. In some
of these lyrics Kjerulf is no more an art-song composer
than Stephen Foster. But throughout he shows that
he is a musician and a man of fine taste, and within its
narrow limits much of his work is admirable.</p>

<p>Anton Dvořák (1841-1904), the greatest of the Bohemian
composers, was known to the world chiefly
through his orchestral, operatic, and choral works.
He, however, published a few groups of songs which
reveal his individual qualities—rich and somewhat
Slavic melody, sound musicianship, and captivating
resourcefulness in many-colored modulation. The
songs have not proved sufficiently numerous or sufficiently
strong to hold a permanent place on concert
programs. There are, however, a number of charming
ones among them, especially the ‘Gypsy Songs,’ which
have the dash of the Brahms <em>Zigeunerlieder</em>, and in
addition more emotional color and more national characteristics.
We should also mention in Germany Eric
Meyer-Helmund (born 1861), represented by ‘A
Maiden’s Wish’; Joachim Raff (1822-1882) with his
charming ‘Serenade’; and Gustav Graben-Hoffmann
(1820-1900) with ‘Five Hundred Thousand Devils.’</p>

<p>Worthy of somewhat more detailed notice is August
Bungert (born 1846), who has recently become more
generally known, in Germany at least, for works of
larger calibre, but whose rather over-pretentious ambition
in attempting to out-do Wagner in a musico-dramatic
tetralogy, <em>Homerische Welt</em>, has made him
appear somewhat ridiculous. Many of his songs, which
show the hand of the technically proficient musician,
are set to words by Carmen Sylva (‘Songs of a Queen,’
etc.). Perhaps his best vein is shown in the simple,
folk-like setting of <em>Ich hab’ein kleines Lied erdacht</em>,
which combines a genuine naïve feeling with fine workmanship
and spontaneous lyric charm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In France, we have said, a multitude of songs were
produced after Schubert had set the fashion. They began,
as we have seen, with Monpou and Berlioz. But
with the exception of the latter we have not a single
original and authoritative voice in French song writing
until the time of Fauré, Debussy, and the later
César Franck. The French song tradition, derived
from the French aria, was indeed distinctive. But it
was badly fitted for intimate interpretation, being cold
in spirit and thin in workmanship. The best that can
be said about this tradition is that it observed a fine
economy of means, never using a note that could not
be heard and that did not make its effect. But in the
truer sense the tradition was not economical, for it
failed to get out of its potential resources one tenth
of the expressive service it might have had. The French
composers were too much occupied with the beauty of
their melodic line, which is so all-important that the
accompaniment is very frequently no more than a re-duplication
of the voice part in the treble, with a few
thin and misplaced chords added. Nor has this over-shadowing
melody any of the warmth of an Italian
tune; on the contrary it is so cold and self-conscious
that it seems to have been put down note by note
after a consultation with a book of rules. Anything
like fertility of polyphonic invention in the accompaniment
is not to be found in the works of this tradition.
All the art is to be expended on the singer’s part. Undoubtedly
this offers considerable exercise to the singer’s
intelligence, for due proportion of outline and of
nuance must be preserved. But the songs from this
period which offer any possibilities to the finer interpretive
ability of the artist can be numbered on the fingers
of one hand.</p>

<p>Charles Gounod (1818-1893) was unquestionably a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
man of great talent. But he abused it miserably. The
composer of ‘Faust’ should have left his mark deeply
on French art. He only added one or two successful
operas to it. His songs show his talent in its picturesqueness
and variety. But they also show with terrible
plainness its abuse. It seems safe to say that
there are not half a dozen of them which a self-respecting
singer can study. On the whole, Gounod is best in
his songs where he is least pretentious—namely, in the
little serenade, ‘Sing, Laugh, Sleep,’ which without
grudging we may call utterly charming. The Barcarolle,
<em>Ou voulez-vous aller</em>, may also be included among the
excellent ones. Then comes a large collection of sentimental
or emotional songs which seem beneath a musician’s
notice—songs such as <em>A la Brise</em>, <em>Mignon</em>, or
the well known ‘Oh, That We Two Were Maying.’ The
last is in a screaming sentimental style which has fortunately
died, except in the vaudeville houses of England.
Some of the concert pieces—like the Arabian
song ‘Medje,’ or the waltz, <em>O legère hirondelle</em>—are
frankly cheap and undeniably effective. Another class
of songs on which Gounod made a glittering reputation
was the religious. One of them, which is quite the best,
set a whole fashion for grandiose lyrics exploiting what
might be called ‘popular religion.’ This song, ‘Nazareth,’
has its marked beauties and doubtless should
not be held responsible for the fruits it produced, especially
in England. Yet even apart from the consideration
of ultimate results we cannot help feeling that
this beautiful song represents a rather theatrical type of
religion. And the other songs are consistently worse.
<em>L’ange Gardien</em> and <em>La salutation angélique</em> have their
beauties, but smell much of the theatre. Others of the
religious songs, like ‘There Is a Green Hill Far Away’
and <em>Temple, ouvre-toi</em>, are execrable.</p>

<p>Two other opera composers who failed to gain Gounod’s
reputation as a song-writer worked with more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
consistent artistic conscience. Ambroise Thomas (1811-1896),
composer of ‘Mignon,’ published a number of
songs, notably the six Italian songs written during his
residence as a <em>Prix de Rome</em> scholar in Italy. His part-songs
for men’s voices also gained great popularity
because of their spirited treatment. Georges Bizet
(1838-1875) was a man of far finer mettle than either
of the two we have named. His numerous songs show
as high a standard of excellence and almost as high
an average of creativeness as the work of any song
writer between Berlioz and Fauré. The best and most
popular of them is the <em>Pastorale</em>. Another excellent
lyric is <em>Après l’hiver</em>. In the <em>Sérénade</em> and <em>Ouvre ton
cœur</em> we find a suggestion of the exotic color which
was popular in Paris at the time. <em>Je n’en dirai rien</em>
illustrates Bizet’s aptitude at the imitation of the antique,
and <em>Qui donc t’aimera mieux</em> is an interesting
and altogether charming trick song for an agile soprano.
Among the other songs which are well worth
knowing are <em>Rêve de la bien-aimée</em>, <em>Ma vie a son
secret</em>, <em>Douce mer</em>, and <em>N’oublions pas!</em></p>

<p>Félicien David (1810-1876), who initiated in Paris the
vogue of the exotic, maintained the fashion as best
he could in his songs, which show a talent for the picturesque
and striking and no small amount of musicianship.
The best of his songs is doubtless <em>Les Hirondelles</em>,
which adds to a charming simple melody
an accompaniment full of picturesque ornamentation.</p>

<p>Camille Saint-Saëns (born 1835), an admirably solid
force in French musical life on the whole, has in his
songs added nothing of importance to the literature of
his time. It is regrettable that he could not here have
shown his acquaintance with the great German masters
as he did in chamber and orchestral music. Ten songs
or so will suggest the character of his work. We find, in
addition to the ‘cold melodic line’ of which we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
spoken, a growing use of dissonance in the later songs,
for emotional or ‘psychological’ effect. If this tendency
had been in any way original to Saint-Saëns and his
fellows, or if it had been developed in a distinctive
fashion, it would have constituted a real claim to fame,
for this is precisely the most marked characteristic of
the fine modern French song literature. As it is, in
such a song as <em>Tristesse</em> we must regard the use of dissonance
as a ‘looking forward’ to modern times, but in
scarcely more than an accidental way. Undoubtedly
Saint-Saëns used his dissonance deliberately and not
accidentally, but the entrance of this feature into
French song as a whole was scarcely more than accidental.
<em>Suzette et Suzon</em> is an example of what the
French are likely to do very well—the imitation of the
antique. This song has a marked charm and there are
many more like it in the literature of the time. <em>Le
Sommeil des Fleurs</em> may stand as an example of the
French emphasis on melody (at the time) and the effect
which they could derive from it. In <em>La Cloche</em> we see
an effort after color and picture painting, though it is
but weak and conventional. <em>Le Pas d’armes du Roi
Jeanito</em>, to Hugo’s words, is a ballad of some spirit
and attempted color. All these songs are filled with
banalities and carelessness of writing. Much more
carefully and creatively written is <em>Clair de Lune</em>, which
tries an interesting experiment with accents. The accents
of the voice part all seem to be misplaced, since
they do not coincide with those of the accompaniment.
In reality both parts receive equal emphasis in the accents,
or rather there are no accents at all. The composer’s
way of writing the song merely emphasises one
more interesting point in French song which, more
than any other, determined the character of its music
throughout the century—namely, the liquid quality of
its verse. We may also mention among Saint-Saëns’
songs the Barcarolle, the <em>Désir de l’Orient</em>, an effective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
concert piece, and <em>Au Cimetière</em>, which is one of the
most popular.</p>

<p>Jules Massenet (1842-1912), tireless composer of operas,
wrote many songs which stand fairly high among
French lyrics of their class. They have a certain facility
and geniality to commend them, and in particular
a voluptuous sinuous contour. Massenet’s use of the
slow 12/8 or 9/8 tempo was one of his chief stocks-in-trade.
But, except as pleasing and unpretentious parlor
songs, we cannot regard them very seriously.
Though his lifetime overlapped the ‘new school’ by
more than two decades, he is distinctly of the old
school. His harmony is quite old-fashioned and he
shows but few traces of the French search for atmosphere.
His one personal quality is an increased sensuousness
of melody, achieved without special aid from
the accompaniment. The best of his songs is among
the earliest, the ‘Elegy,’ adapted from an orchestral intermezzo
which formed part of the incidental music
for <em>Les Erinnyes</em>. In <em>A Colombine</em> he has created a
charming genre piece. In the <em>Nuit d’Espagne</em>, a gentle
and reserved song of exotic tendencies, in the <em>Chant
Provençal</em>, a typical 12/8 melody, luscious yet ‘chaste,’
over the barest of chord accompaniments. In the
sprightly <em>Sérénade du passant</em> he is altogether delightful,
especially in insinuating into the melody more
meaning than meets the ear. On the other hand, he has
written any number of sentimental songs which, like
‘Open Thy Blue Eyes,’ are rubbish.</p>

<p>In the same general school are a number of composers
(some of them Massenet’s pupils) who have
written songs in quantity, some with occasionally
charming results. One of the most fertile and popular
was Benjamin Godard (1849-1895). His work was
marred by the rapidity with which it was written, necessitating
an uncritical attitude on the composer’s part
which is fatal to the general body of a man’s work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
Several felicitous examples of Godard’s work, however,
well deserve their popularity, especially the Berceuse
from <em>Jocelyn</em>, the delicate ‘Florian’s Song,’ and the
spirited Barcarolle, <em>Embarquez-vous</em>. <em>L’Amour</em> may
be taken as an example of the great majority of his
songs—conventional but pleasing.</p>

<p>Of even greater popularity and possibly more originality
is the work of Cécile Chaminade (born 1861),
whose songs occasionally approach a high degree of artistic
finish. In her genre songs Mme. Chaminade is
especially felicitous. Several random examples are
the <em>Chanson Slave</em> and the <em>Chanson Espagnole</em>, among
the pseudo-national lyrics; the <em>Mandoline</em> and <em>Madrigal</em>
and <em>Voisinage</em>, each in a special and easily appreciated
style. In her dainty imitations of the antique the
composer shows her French training and zest—notably
in <em>Auprès de ma mie</em>, <em>Noël des oiseaux</em>, and <em>Ronde
d’amour</em>. In her emotional songs, such as <em>Chanson
triste</em> and <em>Amoroso</em>, she is less distinguished. And in
the religious or grandiose songs, such as <em>Immortalité</em>
and <em>l’Idéal</em>, she is pompous, noisy, and uninspired.
Her creative impulse is not great. Her ideas are most
charming when they are most modest But when she
is working with material that is to her taste she can
manipulate it with a deftness that many a first-rate
composer might be proud of.</p>

<p>A further group of French song writers may be mentioned
because their work contains some elements of
distinction. Gabriel Pierné (born 1863), a musician
of fine endowments and a force in Parisian musical
life, works with deftness and excellent taste, chiefly in
the smaller forms and the more modest ideas. J. Guy
Ropartz (born 1864), a pupil of César Franck, has kept
himself clear of the modern radical tendencies in Paris
and has continued to produce songs in the old manner,
but considerably more vigorous and creative in content
than was once the fashion. Xavier Léroux (born 1863),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
with at least one fine song, ‘The Nile,’ should be named,
and also Augusta Mary Anne Holmès (1847-1903), an
Irish woman who lived and worked in Paris and wrote
songs of large and pretentious outline, best of which,
perhaps, is ‘An Irish Noël.’ Reynaldo Hahn (born
1874), one of the weaker pupils of Massenet, followed
his master’s method to considerable popularity but to
little artistic purpose. Other song-writers who may
profitably be mentioned are Arthur Coquard (born
1846) and George Adolphe Huë (born 1851).</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The position of Edward MacDowell (1861-1911) as
a lyricist is still disputed. Mr. Finck ranks him
among the four greatest song-writers of the world.
In point of sincerity and individuality he was surpassed
by few of his contemporaries. From the beginning of
his maturity on he wrote scarcely a note that did not
bear his personal signature. In two or three of his
songs he is certainly hobnobbing among the great. But
though nearly all his work is charmingly individual,
one may doubt whether he has written a sufficient quantity
of superior songs to entitle him to the rank to
which Mr. Finck assigns him. But the songs are there,
independently of what rank this or that writer chooses
to give him. He is unsurpassed in giving his music
certain special qualities or moods, distinct, yet not got
by strained means—moods such as banter, sentimental
tenderness, playfulness, and the like. The achieving
of such results is one of the ultimate things in
song writing from the technical point of view, and
many first rank composers have been unequal to it.
To achieve it is a special mark of genius for the art-song.
Again, we find that MacDowell’s songs have a
remarkable amount of distinction and individuality;
though the personality of the composer is over all, each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
of the songs has its own personality, too. The range
is considerable; from playfulness, through sensuous
emotion, to deepest tragedy, and each type, at MacDowell’s
hands, is equally individual and almost
equally successful. The MacDowell idiom, derived in
part from Grieg, is used flexibly for many things and
is usually a fine instrument of emotional expression.
We should not, however, leave this listing of the qualities
of MacDowell’s songs without mentioning their
frequent tendency to the banal, a tendency which is
never marked or long sustained, but which appears
in unexpected places to rob the songs of their final
touch of aristocratic distinction.</p>

<p>The earliest of the MacDowell songs is a group of
Scotch melodies, an endeavor to imitate the Scotch
style, yet not so closely as to do away with individuality.
‘Deserted,’ to the old words ‘Ye Banks and Braes of
Bonny Doon,’<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> is appealing and tragic, altogether a fine
piece of work. But the Scotch songs of opus 34 are
more beautiful and more personal. Both ‘Menie’ and
‘My Jean’ (words by Burns) deal in the Scotch cadences
and phrases, but they might also stand as a study for
the great songs of opus 47. The songs of opus 26,
entitled ‘From an Old Garden,’ show MacDowell at his
best in his lighter moods. ‘The Blue Bell,’ which maintains
a mood half of banter and half of pathos, is admirable,
and ‘The Myrtle,’ with its harmonic freedom
yet cogent expression, is of decided technical interest.
Leaving to the last the two greatest of MacDowell’s
song groups, let us make mention in passing of opus
56, two excellent songs, ‘The Swan Bent Low to the
Lily’ and ‘A Maid Sings High and a Maid Sings Low,’
which are as personal as anything the composer has
done; of opus 58 with the pleasing ‘Merry Maids,’ and
of opus 60, with ‘Tyrant Love,’ another very personal
song, and ‘Fair Springtide,’ original and invigorating.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>
<p>The two great opus numbers referred to are 40 and
47. The ‘Six Love Songs’ of opus 40 include one which
is perhaps the best known of all MacDowell’s vocal
work—‘Thy Beaming Eyes.’ In this song we must
admire the strenuousness of the hot emotion which the
composer is able to conjure up, but we cannot help
wishing that he had chosen a medium a little less vulgar.
This song contains much of MacDowells ability,
but of MacDowell’s artistic message it contains less than
almost any other. The second song of the group,
‘Sweetheart, Tell Me,’ is delicate and perfect as a cut
gem. But by all means MacDowell’s greatest song-group
is opus 47, ‘Eight Songs.’ The first of the group
is the second of the composer’s songs in popularity—‘The
Robin Sings in the Apple Tree.’ Nowhere has
MacDowell been more felicitous in the delineation of
mood in tiny details; the number of treasures in this
short song is truly surprising. The ‘Midsummer Lullaby’
is a masterpiece. Again it is the accuracy of mood-painting
that strikes us, this time the hot laziness of
the full summer day. The third piece, the ‘Folksong,’
is in MacDowell’s most vigorous and admirable style.
‘The West Wind Croons in the Cedar Trees,’ ‘In the
Woods,’ and ‘Through the Meadow’ are nature songs
of much distinction, showing grace, buoyancy, or sentiment,
as the case may be. But the finest song of the
group, and the finest of all MacDowell’s songs, is ‘The
Sea,’ to William Dean Howells’s words. Here we have
in full strength the mood of tragic grandeur which has
been struck seldom in modern art-songs. This song,
at least, has not a touch of banality, not a note of mannerism,
not a phrase which is not at once great music
and genuine poetry. Many of MacDowell’s songs are
perhaps too personal to be generally appreciated. Here
is one song which is utterly the product of his individual
genius, but at the same time a universal art-work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>Beyond MacDowell it is not easy to name a single
American song-writer who has any claim to a position
among the song-writers of the world. A few, especially
in very recent years, have shown a marked talent
which may be expected to develop into something
unusual. But, on the whole, the American song output,
though enormous, has been consistently and painfully
second-rate in character. This is not to belittle
the excellent work which certain Americans have accomplished
in this field; but their interest must necessarily
be local. The American song-writers are treated
in detail in another volume,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> so we need here only
mention them and the occasional treasures hidden in
a mass of work too facile and imitative. We should
name, however, one of their number who, with
rather limited talents, has nevertheless made a place
for himself in the hearts of people in Europe as well
as in this country. This is Ethelbert Nevin (1862-1901),
chiefly known among pianists for his charming suites
of short pieces. Nevin’s reputation as a song-writer
rests chiefly on one lyric, ‘The Rosary,’ which has had
a remarkable vogue, well deserved. It is difficult to
find any other of his songs which approaches this in
emotional breadth. But out of his numerous list there
are a few which are well worth knowing. ‘Sleep, Little
Tulip’ is a bit of a lullaby with a charming swing and
a delicate sentiment, given an additional interest by the
lilt of the accompaniment, which is managed with much
skill. ‘A Song of Love’ is above the average in musical
vigor and ‘Orsola’s Song,’ to the French words of Jean
Richepin, imitates with success the Gallic method. <em>In
der Nacht</em>, to German words, is unusual for breadth
and genuineness. Nevin is too often a mere sentimentalist,
too often imitative, too often dependent on mannerisms
and formulas. Some of these mannerisms,
however, are effective, especially that of writing a contrapuntal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
melody in the accompaniments, as in the
second half of ‘The Rosary.’ Though his invention was
facile rather than profound, and his musicianship
slight, we cannot deny him praise for a certain delicacy
of touch, a certain artistic sense of fitness, which were
too often lacking in his American contemporaries.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to mention two song
writers of modern Italy who have shown individuality
and attained wide popularity. Francesco Paolo Tosti
(born 1846), one time teacher of singing to the court of
England, has written a number of songs of varying
quality. His ‘Goodbye Forever’ is none the worse for
having been played on all the hurdy-gurdies of London
for twenty years past. The piece is as moving as any
folk-song and as delicate as a lyric by Jensen. In his
later songs, of which we may mention the well known
‘Serenade,’ he shows more care than in the earlier
ones and the result has been some exquisite works,
combining Italian grace and Italian fervor in equal proportions.
‘At Vespers,’ <em>Amore</em>, and <em>Mattinata</em> are
among his best. Luigi Denza (born 1846) has attracted
a unique position for himself in that one of his lyrics,
the famous ‘Funicula,’ has been circulated more widely
than any other piece of music of which there is record,
having reached a sale of some 500,000 copies. His songs,
which are all simple and addressed to the common
people, are very numerous and include not a few of
great charm and artistic grace.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In a later chapter we shall briefly study the wonderful
song literature which has been created by the Russian
composers in the last half century. From this list,
however, we shall exclude two Russians who were extremely
productive song writers and are still the best
known of their land. For Rubinstein and Tschaikowsky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
though they were born in Russia, were Germans
in their musical education and would have little to
do with the ‘neo-Russian’ group which created the national
art-song. They frequently attempt Russian ‘local
color’ or oriental exoticism, but in nearly every case
their attempt is mannered and self-conscious. Both
suffered from over-production. To be quite plain, they
seem to lack artistic conscience. Rubinstein, in particular,
wrote a great quantity of songs, chiefly to German
and Russian texts, which no sincere artist should
have dared to sign. They were addressed to the drawing
rooms and the tinsel concert halls of the time.
Perhaps they were actually the pot-boilers with which
he sought to eke out his income. Most of them should
be passed over in charitable silence. Tschaikowsky
shows a somewhat higher level of artistic effort, but
too often he writes much noise and little music. His
most pretentious efforts are often built upon themes
that would hardly fill a penny whistle. However, he
errs not so much through the cheapness of his melodies,
as does Rubinstein, as through lack of artistic taste
and control.</p>

<p>Anton Rubinstein (1830-1894), a concert pianist second
only to Liszt, perhaps suffered from being a public
pet. Usually his songs are insufferably sentimental,
with a banality in almost every line which counteracts
the charm latent in the idea. His accompaniments
are usually thin and conventional. His romanticism
is of the rag and tatter type, which calls upon the
stock modulations and phrases in a routine way. One
feels that the composer never <em>saw into</em> his songs, that
he wrote three-fourths of his notes with his eyes shut.
However, he has done a few thoroughly fine songs.
‘The Asra,’ to Heine’s words, is highly emotional and
picturesque. Rubinstein’s setting of <em>Du bist wie eine
Blume</em>, with its delicate piano background, may perhaps
be ranked second to Liszt’s. There is a fine luxuriance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
about the song ‘Golden Rolls the Kura Beneath
Me,’ while <em>Es blinkt der Tau</em> and <em>Die Waldhexe</em> can
command the respect of musicians. ‘Not with Angels’
is another song well worth knowing. Perhaps the lyrics
which show Rubinstein the musician in the best light
are the ‘Persian Songs,’ which combine exotic coloring
and great expressive beauty. Here, probably, the
list ends. The remainder of Rubinstein’s large output
suffers continually from thinness and banality. The
‘Modern Greek Love Song’ is a touching melody of the
simplest type and manages to escape the commonplaceness
which seems always about to engulf it. ‘Be Not so
Coy’ is graceful and musicianly, and ‘The Ravens’ contains
considerable vitality. But it would be useless to
enlarge a list of songs, none of which can be praised
without some reservation. Rubinstein is one of the
composers whose reputation is fast on the wane. We
can part with him with light hearts, for what has replaced
him is hardly second to anything in all song
literature.</p>

<p>Nor in Tschaikowsky’s case need we name the long
list of songs that are only somewhat good. He has a
few that are thoroughly fine. The children’s song entitled
‘Legend’ makes effective use of modal harmony
and remains a most touching and impressive lyric. ‘At
the Ball’ is a melody such as Tschaikowsky could create
on occasion, utterly aristocratic and artistic. Over
this, as over few of his others, the conventional has
not cast its spell. ‘The Canary’ is an elaborate effort
at oriental color and is completely successful, the piano
part being especially fine. The piece is most effective
in the concert hall. Perhaps the best known of the
Tschaikowsky songs is the setting of Goethe’s famous
lyric, <em>Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt</em>. It may be taken
as a type of Tschaikowsky’s average. There is in it a
certain intensity of feeling, but it is all strained, over
orchestrated, as it were, and every now and then—banal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
The long list of Tschaikowsky songs includes
a number which attempt to be impressively dramatic.
They usually make their effect at first hearing, but
they fall to pieces beneath scrutiny. They suggest too
much brass and percussion and too little—music.</p>

<p>Another Slav whose songs are mainly German is
Moritz Moszkowski (born 1851). He wrote with less
ambitious intent than Tschaikowsky and achieved some
charming results, as in his well known ‘Slumber Song.’
But the conventional hangs over his work, and his is
one of the reputations which is fast dying.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The England of the last half of the nineteenth century
has left us little that we can treasure in song music.
Easily the most popular composer of the time was
Sir Arthur Sullivan (1842-1900), who wrote the music
of the inimitable Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, which
are quite as perfect in their way as Mozart’s operas.
If we were to include in this list the songs from these
pieces we should have a song literature altogether remarkable
and charming. But outside of his stage
works Sullivan was surprisingly cheap in his vocal
music. It is hard to explain the quantity of songs he
put out which would hardly have been a credit to a
low-class music hall. They are for the most part unbelievably
sentimental and commonplace. A few of
his less popular songs, however (for example, the
‘Arabian Love Song’ and ‘O Fair Dove, O Fond Dove’),
showed an effort at artistic creation, and among the
popular ones we may find a handful, such as ‘Sweethearts,’
which are tolerable. But in this description we
have omitted one song which is of quite a special calibre.
This is the universally known ‘Lost Chord.’ Perhaps
the piece is unduly sentimental; perhaps the religious
sentiment of it is somewhat theatrical. But on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
the whole it is certainly a fine and noble inspiration.
It is not a bit the worse for its huge popularity. The
musical material is impressive in the extreme and the
handling is admirable.</p>

<p>Frederick Cowen (born 1852) was a prolific composer
of songs (his output numbers nearly 300) and,
next to Sullivan, was the most popular song-writer of
his time. His talent was limited, being wholly satisfactory
only in work of a light and fanciful character.
In this field he well deserves his reputation. But his
sentimental songs are in the worst tradition of the
time. His influence in this sort of music has been huge,
and he may almost be called the father, for England
and America, of the brood of sentimental pieces that
pose as art-songs. He has been a potent factor in the
debasing of the taste of concert audiences, and singers
should know him chiefly as an admirable example of
what to avoid. Why the songs of this class are bad
might perhaps be told on paper. But a far better answer
would be a comparison between them and a few
first-rate songs, say by Franz or Brahms. A little familiarity
with songs of the Cowen type will show how
utterly they fail to ring true to healthy sentiment.</p>

<p>Another popular song writer of Sullivan’s time was
Stephen Adams (1844-1911), whose real name was
Michael Maybrick. The great popularity of his songs of
the sea, such as ‘Nancy Lee’ and ‘The Midshipmite,’ or
of his romantic songs, such as ‘In Days of Old,’ is quite
justified. They do not parade as art-songs (rather they
might be justly called folk-songs), but in their vigor
and straightforwardness they might serve as a model
to many a precious song-writer with more sentimentality
than talent. A more recent song from this composer,
‘The Holy City,’ combines to a remarkable degree
the popular quality with real musicianship.</p>

<p>The most genuine song-writer of this period was
Arthur Goring-Thomas (1851-1892), a man of delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
instincts and fine artistic sense whose work has never
received the recognition it deserves. His field of expression
was not wide, but within it he worked with
a wealth of imagination and refined sense of fitness
which England at the time could not match. He was
the one true romanticist of his land. His product is
perhaps a trifle morbid, but, such as it is, it is free from
tricks and cheapness and is absolutely sincere. As a
sentimentalist, pure and simple, he is among the best.
He was, indeed, one of the few sentimentalists who
could approach the tragic mood without losing in his
music the ring of sincerity. And as an artist of the
voice England for two centuries was not able to show
his fellow. Some of his most perfect work as a lyricist
is shown in his cantata, ‘The Swan and the Skylark,’
and in his operas. His solo songs and duets show the
refinement and polish which is not that of formal learning,
but represents the loving care of an intense artistic
nature. Among the best may be mentioned ‘Wind in
the Trees,’ ‘Barbarine’s Song,’ ‘One Morning, Oh, so
Early,’ and the ‘Night Hymn at Sea.’</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter we should mention the
romantic and colorful work of Liza Lehman (born
1862). Her song cycles, especially those from Omar
Khayyám and Robert Louis Stevenson, are well known.
The former, ‘A Persian Garden,’ offers points of remarkable
interest to the musician. The music, which
covers a considerable emotional range, is equally felicitous
in a number of various moods. The exotic color
of the cycle is managed with rare taste and effectiveness.
The accompaniment is a model of richness and
appropriateness. We can safely say that this writer
is the only woman composer who has ever succeeded
signally in the tragic mood. But her peculiar contribution
(for it can almost be called a contribution) is
the fine artistry with which she concentrates great emotional
feeling into the briefest time. (It is interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
to note that she does it almost entirely by the use of the
<em>da capo</em> or ‘A-B-A’ form.) In the variety of styles at
her command and in the sureness of her artistic touch
she is quite alone among woman composers of the
present day.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>German song since Schubert has known nothing
like a fallow period. In no single decade has the song
product been markedly inferior to any other. After
Schubert and Schumann there came Liszt, Franz, and
Brahms; and after Brahms there came Wolf, Strauss,
and Reger. The Germany of these latter men was, of
course, a very different Germany from that which preceded
the Franco-Prussian War. It was a united Germany,
an increasingly centralized Germany, a more
prosperous Germany. In many ways it seems to be a
more Philistine Germany. But, though the political
and social conditions changed after 1870, this change
was not expressed in the national literature for a number
of years. And in the lyric poetry it was chiefly
the poets of the old régime who held sway toward the
end of the century. These poets had come in on the
reaction that followed the failure of the liberal political
movement of 1848. When men found their political
strivings frustrated they once more turned their attention
to their souls. Chief representative of ‘art for
art’s sake’ was Emmanuel Geibel (1815-1885), an extremely
talented literary man who cultivated the pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
lyric with great success. Geibel was not a man of great
originality. He clung to the old poetic motives and to
the old ideas concerning the relations of man. But
his versification was very engaging, being gentler and
smoother than is usual in German poetry, and his
manipulation of ideas and images was extremely deft.
Next to him in popular esteem was Eduard Möricke
(1804-1875), a Swabian pastor who took to writing verse
as an amusement. In addition to an insinuating use of
image and word music he had that rare quality in a
lyric poet—a sense of humor. His touches of fun are
always wholesome and delightful. Paul Heyse (1830-1911)
was best known as a novelist and short-story
writer, but his lyric gift was marked and his translations
from the Spanish and Italian attained great popularity.
Detlev von Liliencron (1844-1909) was another
of the foremost lyricists of the time. In a later generation
Otto Julius Bierbaum (1865-1909) and Richard
Dehmel (born 1863) were influential. They rank with
Hugo von Hoffmannsthal (born 1874) as the foremost
lyricists of present-day Germany. These men are not
great. They by no means express Germany as Tennyson,
for instance, expressed mid-Victorian England.
But, taken together, they supply the growing demand
for sensuous, subjective poetry and they execute their
task with a fine command over the lyrical qualities of
the German language.</p>

<p>We have not yet finished with the process of ‘placing’
Wolf (1860-1903) as a song writer, but there are
competent critics who would rank him above Schubert
(that is, as the greatest in musical history) and
any number who would rank him just below. Certainly
his work is free from any of the careless or conventional
writing which disfigures so much of Schubert’s
work. The standard which Wolf set for himself in
his song-writing is perhaps more exacting than that
set by any other composer. His songs measure up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
more separate tests than do those of any other one
man. It is evident, then, that his musicianship must
have been of the highest order. He had the benefit
of the great generation of musicians who had followed
Schubert and brought to maturity the work which he
had only begun. Schubert was too often content with
a type accompaniment, a conventional turn of phrase
which only serves to fill up a measure and (what is
worse) with an indifferent bit of music when something
first-rate didn’t enter his head. Moreover, his
technique, from the point of view of accurate emotional
expression, was necessarily limited, since his task was
a comparatively new one. Wolf had this one immense
external advantage—that he began his work after ‘Tristan’
had been written. He was able to write his songs
with an accurate acquaintance with the most powerful
emotional idiom the world has ever seen. Whether or
not Wolf was the superior of Schubert in absolute
genius is another matter. But undoubtedly, taken all
in all, his songs must satisfy modern ears and modern
demands better than those of Schubert.</p>

<p>When we mention Wolf’s debt to Wagner, when we
mention the Wagnerian influence in his songs, we do
not mean that he has been an imitator. The principles
which Wagner exemplified in the opera could have but
a slight application to the art of song writing. Further,
Wolf was far too individual to carry over Wagner’s
precise methods and mannerisms into his work. When
we speak of the Wagnerian influence on Wolf we mean
merely the influence which a supreme master in any
art must exert on all who have studied his work. Wagner
had opened the eyes of men to a musical world
almost undreamed of before—a world of chromatic
harmony and free modulation which had been no more
than vaguely implied in the music preceding him. He
had shown men, by one or two masterful examples,
that the thing could be done; the others then set about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
to do it in their own ways. Among these others was
Wolf, as a young man an adorer of Wagner and constant
student of his scores, a finely balanced musical
nature which could understand and synthesize the work
of great men and recreate out of this understanding
an art that was his own. Accordingly we find Wolf
far more chromatic in his procedure than any song
writer before him, far more concerned with his accompaniments,
freer and more accurate in his treatment
of the voice—yet not a whit less lyrical than any
other song writer who had ever lived. Wolf’s songs
are not Wagnerian operas. His great emphasis upon
the accompaniment as an instrument of expression is
not an imitation of the Wagnerian orchestra with its
function as ‘soul of the drama.’ His use of the germ-motive
is not an imitation of the Wagnerian leit-motif,
standing for a single character or idea. Wolf could
not have <em>imitated Wagner</em> without making his songs
operatic and unlyrical. What he did was to write
songs absolutely in the fine old German song tradition
after he had fertilized his mind and invention with an
accurate knowledge of the works of the greatest modern
German musician.</p>

</div>

<p>Wolf’s two predominant technical qualities were
truly in line with the development of German song,
apart from any extraneous influence. These two influences
were the significance given to the piano part
and the closest accuracy in the treatment of the words.
Wolf’s procedure with the words—his rigid adherence
to the ‘one-syllable, one-note’ principle, his insistence
that the voice part should agree with the special accents
of meaning as well as with the ordinary accents
of prosody—this might have been merely a meticulous
fad with another composer. But with Wolf it truly represented
his attitude toward the art-song, an attitude
strongly contrasted with, say, that of Brahms. He carried
it out not as a rule to be observed (he occasionally
broke it himself), but as an expression of his artistic
feeling. His melody, of course, is somewhat free, but
its musical integrity is never disfigured to meet the
demands of the text. It is genuinely lyrical, but so
managed as to give more regard to details than in most
composers’ songs. Wolf’s piano parts are an unending
delight to the musical student. They are more ambitious,
more complex, more exuberant than those of
Franz, but no less perfect from the point of view of
workmanship. Unlike Franz, again, they are very
highly colored and filled with details which interpret
particular nuances in the text. Especially are they interesting
for doing in an emotional and dramatic way
what Franz so often did in an intellectual way—developing
his piano part from a simple musical germ.
Franz’s accompaniments are charming in the highest
degree, but rarely emotionally moving. Wolf’s speak
with an emotional voice not surpassed in any songs of
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Ernest Newman points out as Wolfs highest glory
the immense variety and distinctness of the characters
he has interpreted in his songs. Heroes, lovers, fools,
warriors, drunkards—these and a host of others he has
put into his music with almost unvarying success.
Newman compares him in this respect with Shakespeare.
Certainly, many of the greatest masters have
shown marked limitations in this respect. Wolf’s interpretative
ability seems almost unlimited. He felt
his poems as few other composers have done. He
worked much as Schubert worked—in a sort of trance,
dreaming over his poems, living and sleeping with his
characters, composing his music in a kind of hypnotic
state and writing down his music with such inspired
insight that the first draft was nearly always the last.
As a result we feel that his interpretation is the ultimate
and perfect interpretation. He seems to have had no
technique, in the sense of a musical system which dictates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
notes of itself. Wolf’s notes were dictated by direct
inspiration as with few other song-writers in musical
history. The songs are as individual as the songs
of Franz and far more dissimilar in the external plan
and contour. There is such a thing as a Franz style.
There is no such thing as a Wolf style; each song stands
utterly by itself.</p>

<p>The numerous songs written by Wolf before 1888
are not to be counted in this general summary of his
work. They are experimental and youthful, showing a
progress toward the masterful maturity of his great
period. But they comprise several which can rank with
his best. Of these we may mention ‘The Mouse Trap,’
an exquisitely humorous thing, and ‘To Rest,’ which is
very tender and moving. ‘Biterolf,’ composed in 1886,
is a warrior’s song, striking the great vein of heroism.
The ‘Serenade’ of 1888 is one of the best known of the
Wolf songs, a piece in which the piano and voice sing
together as if they were parts of one complex instrument.
The fifty-three Möricke songs of the year 1888
include such a number of masterpieces that it may well
be called the most remarkable single group of songs
ever written. The variety and perfection of these songs
would lead one to believe that they were the selected
work of many years of labor. We cannot sufficiently
praise the variety of expression—the human types of
<em>Das verlassene Mägdlein</em>, <em>Agnes</em>, <em>Der Jäger</em>, <em>Erstes
Liebeslied</em>, and the <em>Lied eines Verliebten</em>; the religious
emotion of <em>Auf ein altes Bild</em>, <em>Schlafendes Jesuskind</em>,
<em>Zum neuen Jahr</em>, and the <em>Gebet</em>; the poetry and fantasy
of the <em>Elfenlied</em>, <em>Um Mitternacht</em>, <em>Nixe Binsefuss</em>,
and others; the deep and varied emotion of <em>Der Genesene</em>
and <em>Die Hoffnung</em>, <em>Er ist’s</em>, <em>Nimmersatte Liebe</em>, <em>An
eine Aeolsharfe</em>, <em>Verborgenheit</em>, <em>Lebewohl</em>, and the
<em>Gesang Weylas</em>, the lively humor of <em>Der Tambour</em>,
<em>Auftrag</em>, and <em>Abschied</em>. Humor is also present in the
group of thirteen Eichendorf songs, as in the delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
<em>Der Scholar</em>. The passionate note is finely struck in
<em>Liebesglück</em> and <em>Seemann’s Abschied</em>; and the <em>Nachtzauber</em>
and ‘Serenade’ show a masterful power of poetic
suggestion.</p>

<p>The Goethe songs are generally regarded as, on the
whole, a retrogression after the magnificent Mörike
group. They are slightly less spontaneous, somewhat
too loaded down with detail. But nothing could be
finer as an expression of passion than <em>Hochbeglückt in
deiner Liebe</em> and <em>Komm Liebchen, komm</em>. In the
grand manner are <em>Grenzen der Menschheit</em> and <em>Prometheus</em>,
the latter one of the most magnificent songs ever
written. A certain inimitable dithyrambic humor sings
in the Drinking Songs—<em>So lang man nüchtern ist</em>,
<em>Was in der Schencke waren heute</em>, and <em>Trunken müssen
wir alle sein</em>. Far removed from the Teutonic nobleness
of Goethe are the Spanish and Italian songs, to
words by Geibel and Heyse. Their average is very
high and it is almost at random that we select the following
for mention: <em>Nun bin ich dein</em>; <em>Geh, geliebter</em>;
<em>Ich führ über Meer</em>; <em>Komm, o Tod von Nacht umgeben</em>,
<em>Tief im Herzen</em>, <em>In dem Schatten meiner Locken</em>,
<em>Auf deinem grünen Balkon</em>, <em>Der Mond hat eine
schwere Klag erhoben</em>, <em>Was für ein Lied</em>, <em>Und willst
du deinen Liebsten sterben sehen</em>, and <em>Sterb’ ich, so
hüllt in Blumen meine Glieder</em>. Finally, we should
mention the fine settings to three sonnets of Michael
Angelo, the last things Wolf wrote before going to the
madhouse, hopelessly insane. <em>Wohl denk’ ich oft</em>,
<em>Fühlt meine Seele</em>, and <em>Alles endet was entstehet</em> are
deeply sincere expressions of the pessimism which
comes at times over the greatest of souls.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Gustav Mahler (1860-1910) has received little recognition
as a song-writer outside of Germany. The great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
effort of his life was expended on his symphonies,
which are planned on a scale larger than man had ever
thought of before. In many ways Mahler was a very
great master. As an artist he was unimpeachable. As
a writer for the orchestra he was original and forceful.
As a developer of the new radical technique he holds
a high place in the history of German music. It may
be doubted whether his musical ideas and his power
of musical architecture were equal to the execution of
his stupendous plans. But these faults, if they exist,
do not enter greatly into his songs—at least into the
most typical of them. For Mahler had one quality
which always stood by him when others failed. This
was his intimate feeling for the folk-song. A peasant
by birth, he retained a certain simplicity of soul in
his attitude toward music which seems contradicted by
his great technical complexity. He can reproduce not
only the simple form of the folk-song, but also its
spirit, its naïve literal quality, which takes joy in what
a sophisticated person would find common. This quality
we find very frequently in his songs. The greatest
of these is the group entitled <em>Kindertotenlieder</em>, which
are loved in Germany (and especially in Vienna) almost
beyond any other. These dirges for children have
hardly any parallel in music. They combine an intense
pathos with something of the naïve simplicity of the
child. They are not mere dirges. They are dirges for
those ‘the doubly dead in that they died so young.’
The congenital faults of Mahler are not to be found
here. The songs are almost above criticism from the
musical standpoint. But Mahler the peasant is to be
seen especially in the songs from <em>Des Knaben Wunderhorn</em>,
that wonderful collection of German folk-poetry
which has been such a storehouse for the nation in the
last century. While these have not the spiritual elevation
or the consistently high musicianship of the <em>Kindertotenlieder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></em>,
they preserve an unconventional freshness
of spirit which is hardly less remarkable.</p>

<p>Richard Strauss is generally regarded as the great
continuer of the German song tradition. That he is a
true continuer is perfectly correct. Whether his music,
absolutely considered, is as ‘great’ as people once
thought is still undecided by the public. Some profess
to discover liberal injections of the charlatan in
Strauss’s work. Whether he sometimes gets his effects
by cheap means which the artist in him would
despise is a question to be argued elsewhere. We must,
however, grant him two great faculties—the faculty
of beautiful melody and that of musical ability. In
sheer beauty of theme (and this is especially true in
some of his songs) he is worthy to be regarded as of
the line of Schubert and Brahms. In musical learning
there are probably not half a dozen men in the
world to-day to equal him and there was a time, ten
or more years ago, when he seemed to stand almost
alone. While for some years past his symphonic poems
and operas have overshadowed his smaller work, he
has been known from the beginning as a brilliant
writer of songs, and has not ceased to give some of his
best energies to song composition. The result is a truly
brilliant list of lyrics. We can no more deny the able
musicianship of the later ones than we can deny the
impressive beauty of the earlier. They are far from
being repetitions of each other. This great variety,
both in mood and in technical style, proves what a rich
fund of ideas and artistic power the composer had to
draw from. The technique of the later ones is about
that familiar to us in the Strauss operas, a brilliant use
of dissonance and rapid modulation combined with an
extremely bold polyphony. At the basis of this style is
always a theme or a group of themes as simple, as conventional
in conception as anything in Schubert. It is as
though Strauss were afraid of losing utterly the interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
of the average man and gave him every now and then
a simple tune that he would be sure to enjoy. But it
is more than this. For Strauss is a German of the Germans.
His whole musical culture is truly built on the
great German tradition of Bach-Beethoven-Brahms.
His complexity is only a development of the noble simplicity
of all fine German music. It is right and proper
that his themes should be simple and understandable.
But it is possible, and probably perfectly just, to argue
that he has failed to make the one part of his music
seem a development of the other. We feel here that
the new style and the old are both present, that they are
juxtaposed, that they have not been fused or synthesized.
And this duality, which we feel in some of the
operas and in the later orchestral works, also appears
in his songs. It makes these later songs less admirable,
from the technical standpoint, than those of Ravel,
who has organized his materials into an almost homogeneous
technique.</p>

<p>However the case may stand in this matter Strauss’s
early songs will remain as worthy of a place in the
great German hierarchy. Opus 10 contains a number
of masterpieces. <em>Zueignung</em> is, in sheer beauty, almost
equal to Schumann at his best. ‘The Night’ is a simple
song of great loveliness and ‘Patience’ is a superbly
eloquent piece of emotional writing based on an accompaniment
of simple repeated chords. It is in work
like this that a great composer tests himself out. This
power to achieve great beauty within narrow limitations
is, as we have so often pointed out in the course
of this book, the proof that genuine creative power is
there. These songs which we have just mentioned are
among the very best in the Strauss list. Others of the
first rank are: ‘I Love Thee,’ opus 37, a powerful example
of emotional lyricism; <em>Ich trage meine Minne</em>,
opus 32, a simple piece of marvellous beauty and
grace; and ‘With Thy Blue Eyes,’ opus 56, a song of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
unusually tender and appealing quality. Among the
earlier songs we should mention the charming <em>Morgen</em>;
<em>Wozu, Mädchen, soll es frommen</em>, opus 19; <em>Nachtgang</em>,
opus 29; and <em>Traum durch die Dämmerung</em>, the last
one of the most admired. ‘Rest My Soul’ and the ‘Nuptial
Song’—the former very simple and the latter highly
organized—are stimulating examples of Strauss’s art.
Of the later songs (which seem to show a falling off in
artistic sincerity) we may mention ‘The Three Holy
Kings,’ opus 56, which is a sort of miniature opera, with
an abundance of incidental music in the form of a
stately march. ‘The Lonely One’ of opus 51 contains
a bass part very effectively used and ‘The Valley’ is
musical description of a high order.</p>

<p>Max Reger (born 1873) is a sharp contrast to Strauss.
People have seen fit to describe him as a schoolmaster.
This is justified in that Reger is one of the most eminent
technical musicians in Germany and a master of
strict fugue and counterpoint in the modern idiom
equalled by no one else in the world. His cast of mind
seems to be all with the classics, though he is radical
enough in his musical style when he chooses to be. He
writes largely in the ‘absolute’ forms and seeks none
of the means for effect that are so generally cultivated
nowadays. In these respects he may be a ‘schoolmaster.’
But beneath the austerity of his style there is a
wonderful fund of ideas and along with it a deftness
in using them that makes his technique available for
many very different sorts of music. In his songs Reger
shows a wide variety. The fact which proves that he
is musician and not schoolmaster is that the songs
requiring fancy, deftness, sense of style are quite as
fine as the others. He always considers well what he
writes. By some his songs may not be considered lyrical
as Schubert’s are, but his vocal music is truly music
that can be sung and its effectiveness on the platform
is likely to outstrip expectations. The songs have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
much beauty of melody, much suavity and charm, and
especially a nice adaptation to the spirit of the text.
They contain in rich quantity the gift of humor. In
downright lively fun Reger reminds one of Chabrier.
The songs are all very human. The first feeling one
has in studying them is respect for the man’s musicianship.
But his technical learning is so unfailing that
this quality becomes a bore and one becomes conscious
of the genuineness of the feeling and the accuracy
of expression. Reger’s superb technique has not
used him; he has used it. We may consider it likely
that Reger’s reputation will grow considerably in years
to come. The songs in particular should be more
widely known and loved. They will not tickle lazy
ears, but they will give a rare delight to discriminating
ones. Certainly there are few men working now who
are on the whole more admirable in their songs than
Reger.</p>

<p>Reger’s technical style marks most of his songs. But
underneath they have a distinct individuality. The
Folk-Song in opus 37 is managed with great simplicity
and taste. ‘The Dying Child,’ from opus 23, exemplifies
Reger’s free but well considered harmonic method. ‘Of
Kissing,’ from the same group, shows us another Reger,
as dainty and popular as Brahms in lighter mood.
<em>Traum durch die Dämmerung</em>, from opus 35, has a
wonderful accompaniment of half-suggested interweaving
voices and is considered superior to Strauss’s setting
of the same poem. The long-drawn melodies (in
both the piano and the voice part) of ‘Love-Longings’
show us still another Reger, a master of restrained
sensuous effect. The Lullaby of opus 43 is fitted out
with a very complex accompaniment but retains a
luscious and quiet effect from sheer power of musicianship.
Two of Reger’s best songs are ‘I Believe, Dear
Love’ and the ‘Prayer,’ from opus 62. The former is a
charming scherzo movement and the latter illustrates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
the tendency, increasing in song accompaniments for
half a century, to spread the piano part over an extremely
wide range of notes. ‘The Willow Tree’ of
opus 48 is a study in a style common to the French
song writers, that of gaining emotional effect from the
mere juxtaposition of chords.</p>

<p>The <em>Schlichte Weisen</em> of opus 76 are perhaps Reger’s
most typical and most highly developed product in this
field. These ‘simple tunes’ are not at all simple in
point of technique, making use of all the virtuosity and
finesse of his wonderful musical equipment. The songs
are nearly all in lighter vein and most of them are
brightened with a delicious humor. They alone would
place Reger among the most notable of musical humorists.
None but the trained musician can appreciate all
the technical genius that went into the writing of these
songs. But any music-lover, any concert audience, in
fact, can appreciate their beauty and sprightly charm.
The thirty-six songs maintain a remarkably high level
of creative musicianship, and in point of variety and
taste they are almost unsurpassed. Nearly all of them
are worth knowing, but we may mention a few among
the best. ‘In a Little Rose Garden’ is written in imitation
of the old German <em>Lied</em>. ‘The Child’s Prayer’ is
utterly delightful in its simplicity. The ‘Dialogue’ is
inimitable in humorous description. In ‘The Oath’ and
‘Concerning Love’ the humor is irresistible, and in
‘God’s Blessing’ musical learning has been put to the
service of delicate delineation of mood.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Arnold Schönberg (born 1874) has gained a place for
himself in Vienna as the foremost spokesman of the
ultra-radical school of German music. At the present
time he is gradually coming to similar recognition in
other countries. His musical manner is so utterly foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
to anything else we are familiar with that men
believed for a long time (and quite excusably) that he
was a mere charlatan, one who, failing to gain recognition
by legitimate means, had resorted to the methods
of the sideshow. That such a view is not tenable is
shown by the recent course of events. In his earlier
music he showed a fairly conservative style, based
chiefly on Strauss, and used in a manner nothing short
of masterful. Much of this early music has not been
heard until recently, because of its astounding proportions.
But it was ambition and not incompetence that
kept Schönberg from prompt recognition. His development
into the new style was steady. It could not
possibly have been achieved without a very large fund
of musical learning. The later scores show a contrapuntal
ability which is astounding. The style, in the
later works, is quite without parallel. Harmony is
dropped altogether. Next to nothing remains of the
system of Bach and Beethoven. On the other hand,
the complexity of the contrapuntal web surpasses anything
we have ever seen. The man’s whole effort seems
to be toward exuberant, overpowering counterpoint, a
mass of separate voices mingled in delirious profusion,
with inversions and augmentations and diminutions
that make the brain dizzy. Judged by ears that have
anything of the old-fashioned left in them this music
cannot be beautiful. But Schönberg’s appeal is to a
different faculty, and only time can determine whether
the appeal is justified. Schönberg explains that he is
not trying to write emotional music, or descriptive music,
or music with any sort of a meaning—but just pure
music. If this be music, there are some definitions yet
to be altered.</p>

<p>His songs, however, so far as they are yet catalogued,
do not belong to this last period. The numerous songs
of opera 1, 2, and 3 are of the first period, in which the
style of Strauss was pretty closely adhered to. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
‘Eight Songs’ of opus 6 and the ‘Six Orchestral Songs’
of opus 8 are the product of the second period, the
transition time in which the new Schönberg style was
fairly well developed, but was used with frequent admixtures
of the old. In the work of this period the
hearer has a breathing space and can feel at first hearing
that the music has <em>something</em> in it after all. However,
second period or not, the two groups of songs
we have mentioned will be quite mystifying to the average
student. They are all very long and extremely difficult
to sing. For that reason they are by no means
available for ordinary concert use. They can be sung
only by the highly capable singer and listened to only
by an audience with highly trained ears. Perhaps,
even under these conditions the listener will conclude
they are not worth the trouble. But the one virtue
which we can predicate of Schönberg without fear of
contradiction is ability, and this virtue stands out
strongly in the songs. We may mention from opus 6
the ‘Maiden’s Songs,’ which attains a sense of immense
physical violence. ‘Forsaken’ maintains its mood by a
remarkably powerful use of a constantly repeated
chromatic figure in the bass. But the best of these
songs, and probably the greatest Schönberg has written,
is ‘The Wanderer,’ words by Nietzsche. The other
songs may be chaotic, but this has a cogent form.
Moreover, it has definite melody and an accompaniment
manipulated with a strong sense of design. The
song as a whole is eloquent and impressive.</p>

<p>The Six Orchestral Songs are also arranged for piano
accompaniment and may be sung in concert. They are
rather scenes than songs, being very long and composite
and generally descriptive or dramatic, rather than
lyrical. In them the technical element is all powerful.
<em>Voll jener Süsse</em>, words from Petrarch, is a masterful
study in the free movement of contrapuntal voices
treated as in close harmony. <em>Das Wappenschild</em> is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
magnificent song of action. The basic theme is stirring,
the melody is marked and impressive, and the general
structure is clear and cogent. The song exemplifies
Schönberg’s genius for making his counterpoint seem
to express tremendous power of will. <em>Sehnsucht</em> is a
comparatively simple song, the best of the six for the
student to begin on. <em>Nie ward ich, Herrin, müd</em> is a
magnificent study in powerful counterpoint. The
tempo is slow, the themes are drawn out and sustained
as though played slowly by a ’cello. The piece is extremely
difficult to sustain at this slow tempo and is
a tax on the listener’s attention beyond anything of the
sort that can be called to mind, but if one can feel its
beauty at all one must be impressed by the majesty
of the thing.</p>

<p>Another modern song writer whose work centres
chiefly in Vienna is Joseph Marx, who has been prolific
and successful. His style has many elements of the
modern, but on the whole it is clear and intelligible
and does not require a new set of ears for its appreciation.
Marx’s songs are often fresh and spontaneous
and his sense of proportion is keen. Another of Schönberg’s
contemporaries is Franz Schrecker, whose work
is likewise representative of the most advanced tendencies
of the new Viennese school. This school is rather
left behind by one of Schönberg’s pupils, Anton von
Webern, whose strange song, ‘Over the Borders of the
All,’ is incapable of description in any terms hitherto
used in connection with music. Which men of such a
group will prove valuable to posterity is not to be decided
at first investigation. But it will be well worth
anyone’s while to maintain an open mind and regard
an innovator as innocent until he has proved himself
guilty.</p>

MODERN FRENCH LYRICISM</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>In a previous chapter we have mentioned the work
of a generation of French song writers who represent
the old and conservative school. In the present chapter
we are concerned solely with the new and much
more admirable French school of lyricism. But the
distinction between the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ generations
is not, of course, a distinction of time. Some of the old
generation are now living and writing in the second
decade of the twentieth century, while some of the originators
of the new had begun their innovations as far
back as the late seventies. This overlapping of individuals
is inevitable where one school supplants another.
For that reason we are here dealing with composers
who, judged solely by dates, should have been
treated as belonging to the last third of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>It is well to keep in mind this overlapping. It will
help us to see how fashions change in the world of
art. The whole story of the transition from the old to
the new in French music is of extraordinary interest.
The change seemed to come at a bound, with Debussy’s
first tone poems and piano pieces. But as a matter of
fact no great change comes about in this way. It germinates
and nourishes itself for a long time unseen before
it is ready to strike out as an independent force.</p>

<p>The change is gradual, usually not more than half conscious.
It would hardly be wrong to say that the whole
change, up to a certain point, is accidental. But it is
often difficult to study such a transition in its early
stages. And the peculiar interest of Fauré’s songs consists
in the fact that they enable us to study the whole
preliminary transition from the old to the new in
French music, in simple terms and in steady development.
Fauré was in a sense the laboratory for the new
French impressionistic school. His experiments suggested
dimly what could be done. His groping achievements
showed how one might set about to do it. In
his songs, from the earliest to the latest we see in successive
stages of development the harmonic procedure
of the new school.</p>

<p>What was this change? What distinguished the old
school from the new? It is worth while to answer
this question briefly before touching Fauré’s work in
order to have some touchstone to hold up to the songs
when we come to look at them. In general terms the
change from the old to the new in French music was a
change from the conscious, the deliberate, the intelligent
to the subconscious, the subjective, the sensuous.
The older composers sought always to appeal in some
degree to the hearer’s judgment, to please his sense of
design, to speak with chastened clearness. We have
often, in the course of this book, had occasion to mention
the coldness and conventionality of the French
music of the nineteenth century. Now the newer composers
reacted against all this and set out to change it.
In place of judgment they would have feeling; in place
of the brain they would have the nerves. What matter
about the sense of design if the <em>effect</em> was beautiful?
What matter whether or not you adjudge it to be good,
so long as you feel it to be good? In the new French
music the intelligence can usually go to sleep. Intelligence
is in the music (or rather it was in the making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
of the music) but it keeps out of sight. All the hearer
needs is to surrender himself to the sensations. He
needs delicate ears and responsive nerves. If he has
these he will get poetry and pictures out of the music
in plenty. In other words, it is our old conflict between
knowledge and experience, between judging and feeling,
between the brain and the senses.</p>

<p>Considered concretely, the change from the old to the
new was a change which broke down completely all
the old rules of musical harmony. The old harmony is
represented at its purest in the chorales of Johann Sebastian
Bach. It was a system of harmony based on
pure (triad) chords, with dissonances properly prepared
and resolved. In the old harmony each chord
was like a chiselled block of stone, sharply differentiated
from every other; the stones must fit well together,
but they must always be distinct. The new system
of harmony was founded upon the dissonance used
for the sake of its effect on the ear. Queer mixtures of
dissonance were used freely to produce an unusual
impression on the ear, an impression which soon took
on the name ‘color.’ Chords were now merged and
confused, instead of being kept distinct. Tonalities
and musical ‘keys’ were now becoming meaningless in
a system whose notes rarely agreed with any tonality.
The whole effect was that of being in a world of pure
sensation, a world that seemed to be without reason
and was therefore the better adapted to being <em>felt</em>.
Along with the tendency toward vagueness in harmony
came a tendency toward vagueness in melody.
Various notes of the ordinary major scale would be
altered at the whim of the composer and the surprises
resulting were a fruitful source of sensuous effects.
This freedom in the use of scales tended toward the
now famous ‘whole-toned’ scale—a thing popularly
supposed to have been invented by Wagner, but used,
in reality, in the early days of Wagner by the Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
Dargomijsky. The whole-toned scale makes every interval
a whole step, thus robbing the scale of all internal
variety and of any tonic or central ‘pivotal’
point. This would seem to rob the scale of its possibilities
for color. But curiously enough, it actually
increased them. For as long as the scale is strange, our
ears will inevitably compare it with the scale with
which we are familiar. The result is a constant succession
of surprises to our ears and senses—in short an
increase in the sensuous element. The newer school
also uses the chromatic element to a great extent. In
this it was only continuing the work of Wagner in his
‘Tristan.’ But there was this difference: that whereas
in Wagner’s procedure the chromatic element was
chiefly in the movement of the individual voices, the
chords being constituted much as before, in the new
French school both the voice leading and the chord
building make free use of the semitone. To sum up,
the new tendency is characterized concretely by vagueness
of chord and of scale (with a continual tendency
toward the whole-toned scale); by a free use of unprepared
dissonance chosen chiefly for its sensuous
effect; and by its constant effort to rid itself of the
domination of a set key.</p>

<p>Gabriel Fauré (born 1845) started exactly on a par
with the other French song writers of the seventies.
His melody was tenuous and colorless; his harmony
was thin and regular. Very gradually and very steadily
he developed his colorful and unconventional harmony
and a type of melody which, without being declamatory,
was irregular and intimately fused with the
accompaniment. Besides this cautious radical development,
Fauré had a fairly generous fund of musical
ideas and a sense of form and design superior to that
of most of his contemporaries. It is doubtful if any
one of his songs could be called first-class in absolute
musical value. But his general standard was unusually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
high and steady. In nearly every case his songs are
finished works of art. His faculty of self-criticism was
keen and his attitude toward his art sincere. Though
never a man of power, he possessed a lively intelligence
which served to make him one of the most important
figures in the French musical transition. He was not
a pioneer in the more strenuous sense of the word.
But he was truly a forerunner.</p>

<p>His earliest songs show little that is distinctive beyond
a sensitive feeling for design and proportion.
The best of them are ‘May,’ ‘In the Ruins of an Abbey,’
and ‘Alone.’ In the ‘Tuscan Serenade’ we catch perhaps
the first definite note of a change. It is a very
slight indication, but it is truly a foreshadowing of the
development which was destined to be shown in his
songs and in all modern French music. The indication
we are referring to is in the following phrase:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe20" id="score-p350">
  <img class="w100 p1 p1b" src="images/score-p350.jpg" alt="ilop350" title="p350ilo">
</figure>

<p class="center ebhide p2b"><a href="images/score-p350.png">[PNG]</a>[<a href="music/score-p350.mp3">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>The unconventional note is the G flat. A composer of
the previous musical generation would certainly have
written G natural. The reason is that a long succession
of whole steps is contrary to the spirit of the diatonic
scale, upon which the classical musical system
is based. The diatonic scale contains two half steps
within the octave, thus giving to the succession of notes
variety and to the scale itself individuality. The four
notes which Fauré here uses are the only four adjacent
notes in the scale which do not contain a half step.
Even such a sequence without a half step was too long
to suit the older composers. This sequence was to them
the awkward place in the scale. It was within the letter
of the scale but contrary to its spirit. So the older
composer would have changed the G flat to G natural
and would have felt a distinct gain in grace and fluency.
Perhaps Fauré used the G flat only because it was different.
He may have started his experiments purely in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
a search for variety. But he soon saw its possibilities.
For this increased use of whole tones develops logically
into the whole-toned scale (without any semi-tones
and hence without any existence as a tonality). And
this whole-toned scale is one of the chief features of
the modern French music. But in addition to its melodic
significance this bit of unconventionality on
Fauré’s part had deep harmonic significance. For if
the identity of the diatonic scale is destroyed the whole
system of classical harmony falls down. Without a
definite scale you have no tonic for your harmony to
centre around. And your harmonic scheme loses all
its value as a system and reduces to a use of chords
for themselves (that is, their sensuous value) or for
their relation one with another. When you have
done this your whole musical basis has changed and
a new musical world has come into being.</p>

<p>This first timid attempt on Fauré’s part was rapidly
followed by other experiments, still cautious but logical
and continuous in their direction. In the song entitled
‘Lydia’ we have the following opening phrase:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe25" id="score-p351">
  <img class="w100 p1" src="images/score-p351.jpg" alt="ilop351" title="p351ilo">
</figure>

<p class="center">Lydia sur tes roses joues Et sur ton col frais</p>

<p class="center ebhide p2b"><a href="images/score-p351.png">[PNG]</a>[<a href="music/score-p351.mp3">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>Here the tonality is disturbed not only in the melody
but in the harmony also. Without preparation or
warning Fauré disregards the half-step (B flat) which
would have kept his music true to the diatonic, plunges
apparently into a new key. But the change is not truly
a modulation; the new key is really not a key. For the
persistence of the F in the bass is a foreign element and
shows that Fauré was not aiming at modulation at all.
What he was aiming at was color. It is significant that
the ‘color’ accompanies the words <em>roses joues</em>. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
gentle dislocation of our conventional harmonic
sounds like a blush translated into tones. Fauré had
discovered modern ‘atmosphere.’</p>

<p>From now on Fauré’s experiments in this sort of
thing become more frequent and more radical. In ‘The
Absent One’ he uses ordinary suspensions for their atmospheric
effect. Other songs of the same period—among
which ‘Silvie,’ ‘After a Dream,’ ‘Barcarolle,’ and
‘Over There’ are the best—show traces of the development.
‘Nell,’ in opus 18, shows an increasingly delicate
feeling for the inner voices in the accompaniment; the
broken chords that support this melody are not a mere
harmonic support but a delicate weaving of suggested
voices. The ‘Traveller’ shows increased power and
vigor. The ‘Lullaby,’ in opus 23 (one of his best songs),
shows an attempt to get color by means of regular suspensions
and dissonances, secondary seventh chords,
and the like, all permitted in the old system but employed
here with a special emphasis which is unescapable.
‘The Secret,’ in the same group, shows a similar
attempt. The <em>Chanson d’amour</em> in opus 27 should
be mentioned in passing.</p>

<p>In opus 39 we find the beautiful song, ‘The Roses of
Ispahan.’ Here Fauré uses exactly the same harmonic
device that we have pointed out in ‘Lydia,’ but this time
with more confidence:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe25" id="score-p352">
  <img class="w100 p1" src="images/score-p352.jpg" alt="ilop352" title="p352ilo">
</figure>

<p class="center">Ont un parfum moins frais ont une odeur moins douce</p>

<p class="center ebhide p2b"><a href="images/score-p352.png">[PNG]</a>[<a href="music/score-p352.mp3">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>The awkwardness and uncertainty in the former passage
is not to be found here. Fauré has discovered his
medium. Henceforth he will use it with increasing
boldness and success.</p>

<p>The ‘Nocturne’ of opus 43 and <em>Les présents</em> of opus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
46 show still more freedom in the use of constantly
changing tonality. ‘Tears’ in opus 51 uses the chromatic
shift of key almost continuously. But the trick
has ceased to be a technical experiment. It has become
a means of artistic expression. For this song, along
with ‘In the Cemetery,’ shows tragic energy and a moving
personal appeal which, as we have seen, had been
all but absent from French song for half a century.
<em>Mandoline</em> and <em>En Sourdine</em> in opus 58 are songs of
consummate artistry and ‘The Prison’ of opus 74
reaches a very high emotional standard. The later
songs show Fauré using generously the technical freedom
which he so laboriously attained. But the songs
are now less interesting. They are too likely to be
abstruse without being inspired. Technically they are
of extreme interest, but they suggest that Fauré had
been left behind by the modern musical movement and
was rather breathlessly trying to catch up.</p>

<p>Though Fauré’s songs do not speak with the authority
of genius they are extraordinarily fine in their deftness
of handling, in their delicacy, in their unfailing sense
of artistic fitness. Fauré, among the first of his generation,
treated the accompaniment with respect. His
piano parts are filled with interesting voices and gently
stimulating movement. Each song has its individuality
and style. The melody is sometimes truly eloquent,
but too often partakes of the colorless nature of contemporary
music. In the later songs the voice part is
apt to be without much charm or even existence of its
own, being only accommodated to the accompaniment.
On the whole, though the absolute value of his songs
would not justify the relative space we have here devoted
to them, they reveal a sensitive and thorough
craftsmanship which French music had too long been
without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Emmanuel Chabrier (1841-1894) was, with Fauré,
one of the great forerunners of the modern French tendency.
His service was chiefly performed in the field
of orchestral coloring, but his songs show the influences
of the new technique and are of much value in
themselves. Chabrier was a more vital man than
Fauré. His abundant animal spirits can be felt in all
his music. His musical ideas were not always of much
value, but the creative energy of the man is felt always.
He was a great practical joker and has written some
of the most delightful humorous songs we have. Three
of his animal songs in particular are worth study. ‘The
Grasshoppers’ makes continual use of the interval of
the diminished second, lightly played in arpeggio
chords on the piano, to suggest the chirping and rattling
which we hear on a summer night. The melody, too,
is extremely graceful. ‘The Pigs’ Pastoral’ suggests
the animals’ grunts and offers even more dignified
points of technical interest. The ‘Villanelle of the Little
Ducks’ is a masterpiece. The charming words by
Rosemonde Gérard (later the wife of the poet Rostand)
are caught with absolute fidelity by the composer.
The dignity, the absolute soldier-like seriousness
of the little birds is inimitably suggested and the
clear and richly varied accompaniment shows a musicianship
of a high order. The simple ‘Romance of
the Star’ reveals the genuine lyric ability of the composer
and his colorful romanticism is shown in the
‘Song for Jeanne’ and ‘The Happy Island.’ Chabrier’s
songs show admirable energy and resourcefulness. As
a practical joker the man can hardly be surpassed.</p>

<p>Among the pioneers of modern French music César
Franck (1823-1890) holds the highest place of all. His
profound musicianship, his open-mindedness, his
strain of religious mysticism in the service of his high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
personal integrity, produced results than which French
music can show nothing more admirable. A large number
of the most eminent modern French composers
were his pupils and their daring (though various) individualities
show that his teaching was really a stimulation
and nourishment of artistic power, not an imparting
of rules. His songs (at least the later ones, which
are all that interest us here) are few, but among them
are several which are artistically flawless. The melody
of ‘The Marriage of the Roses’<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> has a grace and a cogency
which utterly charm the hearer. ‘The Bells of
Evening’ and ‘The Procession’ have become classics in
modern song literature. Technically these songs are
not radical. But they make effective use of the new
harmonic method, in Franck’s own peculiar and convincing
manner.</p>

<p>Four of Franck’s pupils have done fine service in the
cause of modern French song. Guillaume Lekeu (1870-1894)
was an extremely talented man who would certainly
have been one of the greatest of French composers
had he lived to artistic maturity. His fine song,
‘On a Tomb,’ proves his creative power and his technical
control. Henri Duparc (born 1848) was by birth
one of the older generation and his use of the modern
harmonies is conservative. Of his numerous songs
some are marked by much grace and sensuous beauty,
notably ‘Invitation to the Journey,’ the <em>Chanson triste</em>,
and ‘Ecstasy,’ the last one of the finest songs of the
period. Ernest Chausson (1855-1894) showed remarkable
talents—energy, individuality, command over romantic
expression. In his incomplete career he produced
many songs, some of rare charm. But most important
of the Franck pupils is Vincent d’Indy, probably
the most vigorous creative power in modern
French music. In him the intellectual quality dominates
all the others. To many his music quite lacks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>charm. The gentler qualities are absent. There is no
obvious appeal to the senses. But his music is extremely
stimulating to the musician and if well presented can
plead for itself to the general public. His songs are
few, but are evidently worked out with great care. Best
known is the ‘Sea Song,’ which has a large rhythmic
sweep admirably suggesting the swell of the ocean.
His arrangements entitled <em>Chansons Populaires du Vivarais</em>,
though applied to the simplest of musical materials,
reveal his intellectual quality of musicianship.
A list of his other songs (nearly complete) includes:
‘Thecla’s Complaint,’ ‘Madrigal,’ <em>L’Amour de la crane</em>,
‘The First Tooth,’ ‘Mirage,’ and ‘The Eyes of the Beloved
One.’ All these songs are fine and musicianly.
But their appeal is limited, for many will find them
lacking charm and sensuous beauty.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>At the present time it is difficult to regard Alfred
Bruneau (born 1857) as a pioneer. His style is extremely
thin and his melody seems at first glance to
be cut from the same piece as Massenet’s. But it is as
an innovator that Bruneau is chiefly valued in France.
In the early nineties, when Debussy was still an unknown
experimenter (a ‘crazy man,’ like all radical
innovators in their early years), he was thrilling Paris
with his strange, new expressive harmonies, accurately
delineating moods and suggesting colors. His operas,
to librettos or adaptations from Zola, were a new thing
in France. He experimented largely with unconventional
harmonies and phrases for the voice which fell
into no known category. Paris was at first puzzled, but
quickly caught the idea. This was because, while Bruneau’s
music was truly an innovation and absolutely
in line with the work of the new French school, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
based on an idiom that France knew well and was
managed so cautiously that the novelties were clear to
the audience without being painful. By this time Bruneau
seems little more than a composer of a past generation.
Yet we must give him full credit for courage,
for artistic feeling, and for considerable musical creativeness.
His songs are not many. The <em>Lieds de
France</em> (words by Catulle Mendès) are simple lyrics
somewhat in the older traditional style of French songs,
executed with a wealth of the most delicate suggestion
of color. ‘The Gay Vagabond’ is in Bruneau’s most
typical style—a clear-cut and flowing melody over the
simplest of chords, with the unusual features so discreetly
written that at first hearing they hardly seem to
be there at all.</p>

<p>Paul Vidal (born 1863) is only by courtesy included
in the present chapter. He has escaped the curse of
the old French school but his talent lies not at all in
the field of innovation. He is a born lyricist, spontaneous,
fresh, graceful. He is master of more than one
style, as his settings of Shakespeare’s lyrics prove. The
‘Winter Song,’ from ‘Love’s Labor Lost,’ preserves a
certain archaic flavor that is charming. The <em>Psaume
nuptial</em> is grandiose but not pompous, an invigorating
piece of honest music. In the children’s song, ‘The
Play Leader,’ Vidal attempts the descriptive, with a
liberal use of dissonance and modern harmony, but
it is evident that he has no natural turn toward the new
style. Yet the song is dainty and picturesque. The
<em>Ariette</em> ‘Were I a Sunbeam’ and the ‘Address to the
Well Beloved,’ as well as a more recent song, ‘Loving,’
are well worth knowing for their simple musicianly
beauty, and <em>Madame la fée</em> is a model of delicate lyricism.
In his more ambitious mood Vidal is represented
by ‘Thine Eyes.’ But he is a composer to whom we
turn not for stimulation in technical matters, but for
simple beauty. His songs are in that class which can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
hardly enter into a history at all, but are delightful
byways to turn to for mere pleasure.</p>

<p>Gustave Charpentier (born 1860), composer of the
world-famous opera ‘Louise,’ has written a handful of
songs, some of superior quality. The <em>Chansons à danser</em>
are written in imitation of the old French dances,
the spirit and the form being caught with keen insight.
The best of the group is the ‘Sarabande.’ In the <em>Fleurs
du mal</em> he is working in more familiar vein—that spirit
of intense and somewhat chaotic emotionalism that distinguishes
his operas. When we list the fifteen <em>Poèmes
chantés</em> we have named all his songs. Charpentier’s
style is modern and genuinely French, but it is sharply
distinguished from that of Debussy and Ravel. It is a
development of that of Massenet (whose pupil Charpentier
was), but it is developed an immense distance
beyond ‘Thaïs.’ It contains more of the flesh (and
more of the open air) than Debussy ever shows. ‘Atmosphere’
for its own sake enters into his work not
at all. Everything is expressive and nearly everything
expressive of human emotions. The musical style is
admirably adapted to the purpose, choosing from the
modern French technique just those elements which it
can use. It makes constant use of detached or irregular
phrases of melody and these it interweaves in great
abundance into the harmonic texture. Charpentier
strikes an admirable middle path in modern French
music, being neither too intellectual, like d’lndy, nor
too technical, like Ravel.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Concerning Claude Debussy (born 1862) the world is
not yet decided. At one time he seemed the supreme
innovator and the master tone-poet of modern times.
Nothing so utterly new had ever come to people’s ears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
since ‘Tristan,’ or probably since the later symphonies
of Beethoven. He was for a number of years the chief
spokesman for the ultra-modern to the whole world.
For fully ten years he worked away, striving for the
vision he had before him, until recognition finally came.
From this very fact we may assume that he is an entirely
sincere artist and not a charlatan as he was once
considered. And, because he could work so consistently
in his own style, he seemed to the world supremely
creative. Possibly sober opinion has modified
somewhat the opinion of ten years ago, when <em>Pelléas et
Mélisande</em> was a startling novelty. The technical power
with which he presented an absolutely new case remains
as admirable as ever. But opinion of the absolute
musical value of his work is somewhat diminishing,
now that we are accustomed to the idiom. In plain
words, it is beginning to be understood that Debussy
repeats himself more than do most great composers,
certainly more than a composer of the first rank would
do. Moreover, his music does not hold a place in people’s
hearts. It is truly expressive of delicate moods
(moods in which the nerves and senses are chiefly involved);
but it does not express the things that are nearest
to human beings. At bottom, the variety possible to
Debussy’s style is slight. He has painted many pictures,
bearing many different titles, but all are mere rearrangements
of the same figures and setting.</p>

<p>We find, to a greater extent than with most composers,
that his whole art is fairly represented in his
songs. They are numerous. And they are of a very
high order of musicianship. It is evident Debussy put
the best he had into these songs. They are luxuriant
with the finest inventions of his remarkable technique.
Not one is carelessly executed. Not one but is in some
degree truly creative. Whether simple or abstruse,
they make no concessions to popular effect. Some are
valuable chiefly in their parts; as a whole they are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
firmly bound. But others are admirable in design and
proportion. In most of them the accompaniment is so
luxuriant that set form goes by the board; the song consists
of its various parts. But in the accumulation of
these various sensuous effects we get a new kind of
unity. It is the unity of the impressionist painters—a
synthesis performed in the observer or listener instead
of being performed in the work itself. To speak concretely,
the various parts reveal sometimes little to connect
them with each other; they seem little amenable to
any formal scheme. But when the listener simply listens,
without trying to apply mental standards, he finds
that he has lived through a single and definite <em>experience</em>.</p>

<p>It is hard to speak in detail of Debussy’s songs. They
present so many individual elements of interest that, if
they are to be studied at all, they must be studied in
the concrete. Any attempt to describe or characterize
them at a distance must be vague and colorless. We
can only point out a few of the songs that stand out
from the others by reason of great technical originality
or impressionistic power. Debussy gained the <em>grand
Prix de Rome</em> in 1884 and spent the next three years
in Italy. His prize cantata, ‘The Prodigal Son,’ shows
evidences of the impressionistic style, but, being offered
to please a conservative committee, was kept in reserve.
But Debussy knew what he wanted to do and
promptly sent back from the Villa Medici a work which
the committee could not accept because of its daring
style. Even then he was approaching maturity in the
manner which made him famous. The first of the well
known songs were published in 1890 and were probably
written in the course of the five years just preceding.
They are not so involved as the later songs, but
they cannot be called experimental works. The <em>Mandoline</em>,
a masterly little genre song, has attained great
popularity, and ‘The Fountain’ shows the composer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
working on a most elaborate scale with a fully developed
technical method. We should also mention in
this place the famous aria, ‘Azaël,’ from ‘The Prodigal
Son.’ The most strongly creative of Debussy’s works
(exclusive of the opera) seem to centre around the year
1904. And here we find some of the best songs. We
may instance the five fine ‘Poems’ from Baudelaire.
In these Debussy is putting forth his very best. The
<em>Harmonies du soir</em> may be taken as an epitome of his
whole harmonic method. ‘The Balcony’ is very long
and rich in descriptive imagination. The <em>Jet d’eau</em>
and ‘The Death of Lovers’ should also be mentioned
from this group. ‘The Faun’ and ‘The Grotto,’ from
the same period, show Debussy at his best. The former
in particular reveals him admirably as a painter of pictures
in tones. Among the fairly simple songs (always
the best for the student who is approaching a new
style) we may mention <em>Beau soir</em> and the <em>Romance</em>.
The <em>Proses lyriques</em> are very ambitious, very long, and
very difficult. Even the most capable singer will find
it hard to hold them unified when they are sung. The
voice part is free, not exactly declamatory, but fragmentary
and merged with the symphonic comment
which is the accompaniment. Of the four <em>Les Fleurs</em> is
perhaps the best, while the last, <em>Le soir</em>, is the simplest
and the most approachable. The <em>Chansons de Bilitis</em>
are more emotional and not so good. But the three
‘Ballads of François Villon,’ published in 1910, are masterpieces.
The Prayer to the Virgin Mary is admirably
pathetic, and the third, ‘The Ladies of Paris,’ shows Debussy
in his sprightly vein, which he manages with capital
humor and verve. The <em>Fêtes galantes</em> (words by
Verlaine) include two very typical songs, <em>En Sourdine</em>
and <em>Clair de lune</em>; the second extremely successful in
the creating of ‘atmosphere’ and the first unusually
appealing in melody. Finally we may mention the
<em>Ariettes oubliées</em>, published in 1913, which include<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
one admirable song, the ‘Belgian Landscape,’ which is
clear and picturesque.</p>

<p>Maurice Ravel (born 1875) has a more vital talent
than Debussy. Though the idiom he uses is remarkably
similar, he manipulates it with greater incisiveness of
effect and hence can make it expressive of emotion
and physical energy to a greater extent. Where Debussy
avoids the harsh and crude, Ravel often delights
in it. Moreover, of late years, he has shown a marked
change in his style (which cannot be said of Debussy).
For, while the radical French music of the nineties was
preëminently harmonic (insisting on the absolute effect
of strange chords for its effect), Ravel has made his
increasingly polyphonic. This he seems to have got
from the Russian, Stravinsky. Undoubtedly this is a
more vigorous method and especially one which is
capable of a longer life and more variety of expression.
And with it Ravel has accomplished fine things.
The new French school, which with Debussy seemed
in danger of degenerating into meticulous preciosity,
will surely not see its energy exhausted at Ravel’s
hands.</p>

<p>Perhaps most typical of Ravel’s songs, and admirably
representative of his earlier technique, are the five descriptive
songs grouped under the title <em>Histoires naturelles</em>.
The animals here described with inimitable
humor are respectively the peacock, the cricket, the
swan, the king-fisher, and the guinea fowl. It is evident
that these offer a wide variety of effect. In each
case Ravel has seized the opportunity in masterly fashion.
The accompaniment to ‘The Peacock’ fairly shimmers
with gorgeous coloring. ‘The Cricket’ is strident
and mechanical, ‘The Swan’ slow and sensuous, and
so on. Perhaps the student may not find such subjects
proper for song treatment. But if descriptive music is
admitted at all in song writing, one must admit the fine
and supple technique displayed in these extraordinarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
successful songs. The group entitled ‘Scheherezade’ is
no less masterful in its description of scenery and
moods. The first, called ‘Asia,’ is unbelievably rich in
this respect. Finally we may mention the three poems
from Mallarmé, published in 1914. These are the most
elaborate and difficult, the most remote from conventional
expression of anything Ravel has done. They
are more solid and stimulating in their musicianship
than anything he had done before. The irregular
melodic line of <em>Placet futile</em> is luxuriant in the extreme.
All three show a gain toward freedom in the
management of the voice, a gain which means a great
increase in absolute musical value for the voice part.
He seems here even to be creating a new sort of melody,
one which has few elements of formal regularity but is
rich in sensuous loveliness. The accompaniments for
these songs are elaborate in the extreme. What the
ultimate artistic value of them will be can not be told
until they have been generously tried out by experienced
singers. But they certainly give the musician
pause. They, along with certain recent orchestral
works, prove that Ravel is a man of immense energy,
of an artistic genius that cannot be curbed, altogether
one of the important men in modern music.</p>

<small>MODERN LYRICISTS OUTSIDE OF GERMANY AND FRANCE</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The new Russian school: Balakireff, etc.; Moussorgsky and others—The
Scandinavians and Finns—Recent English song-writers.</p>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>We have referred in another chapter to the neo-Russian
school of composers, who worked under the influence
of Mily Balakireff and based their composition
largely upon the native folk-songs. It is this group
that has created Russia’s musical art. Tschaikowsky
and Rubinstein are, in the Russian view, out of the
direct line of succession. In the direct line, which commences
with Glinka, we find a distinguished company
of geniuses. After Glinka comes Alexander Dargomijsky
(1813-1869), one of the earliest converts to Wagnerian
principles outside of Germany and a radical
innovator in dramatic and harmonic method. His opera,
‘The Stone Guest,’ looks forward a quarter of a
century to modern harmonic effects, whole-toned scale
and all. But, in consideration of the time he was working,
it is not to be expected that his songs are of a radical
cast. They, however, show the innovating genius
of the man and his full-blooded artistic life. Some
ninety in all, they are extraordinarily varied in style
and contents, some graceful and elegaic, some exotic,
and some humorous. Dargomijsky took the traditional
mantle of Russian genius upon his shoulders in satirizing
the bureaucracy and wrote some of his finest humorous
songs on the subject. Among the best of his
songs we may mention ‘An Eastern Song,’ ‘I Think that
Thou Wert Born for This,’ and ‘O Maid, My Rose.’ His
dramatic ballads, of which ‘The Knight Errant’ and
‘The Old Corporal’ are the finest, are marked by directness
and simplicity which give them a rare laconic
force.</p>

</div>

<p>Dargomijsky was one of the older generation, a sort
of father confessor to the neo-Russian group. This
group worked under the inspiration of Mily Balakireff
(1837-1910), a young enthusiast with fine visions and
a considerable knowledge of music, mostly self-learned.
It was he who first of all gave the great emphasis to the
use of folk-songs in Russian composition and this he
made the cornerstone of the new school. As members
of his little group he was lucky enough to have two
geniuses of very nearly the first order, one Modest
Moussorgsky (1835-1881) and the other Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakoff
(1844-1908). Balakireff’s own songs
show artistic qualities of a high order; they are
marked by unfailing taste and proportion and range
over a broad field of expression, nearly everywhere
successfully. But, though his artistic and critical sense
was superb, he had not the creativeness of most of the
group. One man who has done much finer work in
song than he is Alexander Borodine (1834-1887). Borodine
entered the neo-Russian group as a mere amateur,
but he became filled with the new enthusiasms and
set himself to work in earnest. The high and consistent
creative level of his work, considering his short and
interrupted study and the smallness of his output, is
amazing. He wrote some twelve songs in his lifetime
and fully half of them are masterpieces. Borodine was
courageous in his attitude toward new musical principles
and extremely happy in his use of the new materials.
Expressive dissonance, in particular, he uses with
rare effectiveness. The ballad or romance entitled
‘The Sleeping Princess’ is surely one of the finest things
of its kind in existence. The spell of the enchanted forest,
the calm beauty of the sleeping princess, are suggested
in a succession of major second dissonances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
which weave a web over the mysterious melodies of
the accompaniment. The same power of creating ‘atmosphere’
with simple means is shown in ‘The Sea-Queen,’
which is an exquisite inspiration. The romance,
‘A Dissonance,’ is a gem of concentrated lyricism.
But the most original of Borodine’s songs, one
of the most memorable of the whole Russian product,
is ‘The Song of the Dark Forest.’<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> This is written purely
in the Russian idiom, with a great and savage melody
which is irresistible in its vigor. The accompaniment
only duplicates the voice part, with the addition of dissonances
that sound forth like trumpet blasts. With
his handful of songs and his definite quantity of genius
Borodine has made a place for himself in the history of
lyric music.</p>

<p>César Cui (born 1835), who was in early years the
press agent of the neo-Russian group, need be mentioned
here only to be passed over. His song output
is generous and nearly always marked with much grace
and good taste. But Cui took less stock in the adoration
of the folk-song than the other members of the
group and his art product is in every way weaker.
Rimsky-Korsakoff combined an intense feeling for
the native Russian idiom with an exhaustive knowledge
of the technique of music and produced a large
number of works which, while being truly Russian,
seem not unnatural to western ears. He is shown in
romantic vein in two early songs, ‘On the Georgian
Hills’ and ‘A Southern Night.’ His oriental songs are
perhaps the best known of his lyric works. In these
the greatest modern master of musical exoticism has
brought vividly to our ears not only the phrases, but
the very spirit of the east. The ‘Hebrew Love Song’
may be taken as one of the best of the group. But
the greatest of the neo-Russian group, the greatest Russian
composer hitherto, and one of the great composers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
of all musical history, was Moussorgsky. This
man was utterly absorbed in the Russian folk-song and
based his style on nothing else. He had the faculty of
genius which goes straight to the heart of something
new and produces his result without seeming effort.
Few musicians of the nineteenth century have spoken
with so individual a voice. The world is only beginning
to appreciate the greatness of his operas. As for his
songs, they have made their way even more slowly,
but where they are once known they are never forgotten.
Moussorgsky’s many remarkable qualities are not
to be set down in a single paragraph like the present.
Suffice it to point out his harmonic originality, which
made use of atmospheric chords, unusual scale combinations,
and powerful modulation long before Debussy’s
time (Debussy, in fact, confesses to have learned
much from Moussorgsky); his freshness of inspiration,
which has produced some of the most glorious of melodies;
and his unsurpassed ability in the delineation of
character and mood. His songs are not a great many,
but there are few of them that are not masterpieces.
His pictures of peasant life are marvellous in their persuasive
picturesqueness. As an example we may quote
the ‘Peasant Cradle Song,’ one of the greatest of songs
anywhere. The ineffable pathos of the beginning, the
strange ethereal light of the end, are hardly to be paralleled
in the whole range of song. But it is more than
a mere lullaby; it is a peasant’s lullaby and the music
almost makes us see the poor hut in which the mother
croons her song. Another lullaby, the ‘Cradle Song of
the Poor,’ is hardly less appealing, but is totally different
in design. Another song showing Moussorgsky’s
highest genius is the <em>Hopak</em>, a long piece with admirable
picturing of various phases of Russian character.
The song is tremendously effective in concert.</p>

<p>Moussorgsky’s three song groups are all of the highest
rank. In the Nursery Songs he has done what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
no other composer has ever done better, and not more
than two or three have done so well. He has depicted
the events and emotions of a child with the simplicity
of spirit of a child. The songs, however, are not simple
technically—so much the contrary that, composed in
1868 to 1870, they are prophetic of future musical procedure.
This freedom and delicacy of delineation had
never been seen in songs before. The four ‘Death
Dances’ are tremendous songs of grim tragedy; in
‘Death and the Peasant’ the accompaniment depicts the
indifference of nature at the fate of the peasant who
is dying in the snow after a debauch. The most amazing
product of Moussorgsky’s lyrical genius, however,
is his last group of six songs—‘Where No Sun Shines.’
These, written in the later years of his life, under the
influence of the deepest pessimism, are perhaps the
most intense expression of spiritual despair in all song
literature. The extraordinary technical method of
these pieces, hardly less than that of the remarkable
children’s songs, was Debussy’s chief guiding light in
the early years of the development of his style. In absolute
musical value these six last songs stand very
high and ‘By the Water’ has few parallels in song
literature.</p>

<p>The remaining Russian song writers can be summed
up briefly. Antony Arensky (born 1861) is the composer
of many songs, graceful and pleasing but not
highly original in style. Sergius Taneiev (born 1856)
inclines to the conservative and classical, but is an able
musician and capable song-writer. Alexander Glazounoff
(born 1865) has worked with most success in the
smaller forms and in his graceful songs has put much
that is charming, though little that is genuinely inspiring.
His work is marked by its extraordinary suavity
and taste. Michael Ippolitoff-Ivanoff (born 1859) has
composed some ninety songs, distinguished by a
straightforward honesty of method and healthfulness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
of feeling. Sergei Rachmaninoff (born 1873) is a
much greater man than those we have just named and
a masterful song-writer. He is not always, however,
writing in the strenuous eastern idiom. ‘Before My
Garden’ and ‘Lilacs’ are excellent in the conventional
way. But he has written at least one truly great song
of genuine Russian inspiration. This is ‘Oh, Thou Billowy
Harvest Fields,’ which deserves to rank with Borodine’s
‘Song of the Black Forest’ in daring and stark
power.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Since the time of Grieg, song writing in Scandinavia
has flourished. The chief Norwegian exponent of the
art is Christian Sinding (born 1856), a hardworking
and sincere artist, with occasional flashes of something
near genius. His many songs include settings and
adaptations of Norwegian folk-songs, which he has
handled with rare taste. He has put something of their
directness into his own art, for he is one of the best of
the modern song-writers in his power of getting the
nub of an emotion in a few notes. His song product is
uneven, for much of his work has been hurried and
routine in quality. But there are many pieces of superior
character and these reveal a quality which is above
all things lyrical.</p>

<p>Emil Sjögren (born 1853) is probably the foremost
song writer of Sweden. He is not a man of power.
His range of expression is limited to the graceful and
tender. Much of his work is of the second order. But
very often he produces lyrics of quite original beauty.
Among these we may mention <em>Du schaust mich an</em>,
<em>Jahrlang möcht’ ich</em>, and <em>Ich möchte schweben</em>. The
second, in particular, should prove highly effective in
concert. Of recent years Sjögren has cultivated the new
harmonic style with much industry and acquisitive talent.
He has, in fact, changed his style completely. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
is doubtful if he can be said to be wholly successful
in his metamorphosis. He seems over-concerned with
details and fails to attain cogency of form.</p>

<p>Jean Sibelius (born 1865) is the greatest of Finnish
composers and is rapidly coming to be recognized as
one of the greatest in the world. We must remember
that the Finns are dominantly Teutonic, and that culture
has been Teutonic in the past and not Russian
or Mongolian as is sometimes supposed. But Sibelius
has developed a marvellous individuality of expression
which is at once expressive of him and of his nation.
Some of his songs are epoch-making in their form and
method. In the more graceful lyrical mood Sibelius is
often charming. We may mention ‘Idle Wishes’ and
‘Oh, Wert Thou Here’ as of this class. In the simple
folk-style Sibelius is even more individual. ‘A Little
Flower Stood on the Wayside’ is a thing of remarkable
tenderness and beauty. But it is when Sibelius strikes
his national idiom that he is at his greatest. This idiom
is characterized by long, slowly-moving, angular
phrases, with frequent repetitions of the same note.
The style is admirably presented in the long song ‘To
Frigge.’ The accompaniment is scarcely less simple
than the voice part, yet it is truly delineative. The
song is a model of pure genius creating something quite
new and very beautiful out of materials so simple that
they have been left by the wayside as useless. <em>Des
Fahrmanns Bräute</em> is a very long ballad of great
strength. But Sibelius is at his greatest and most original
in the ‘Autumn Evening,’ a song which has no fellow
anywhere. Sibelius’s method here is unique. The
song is almost recitative, but the various irregular
phrases of the voice have an incisive quality which
makes them rank as descriptive. The accompaniment
is little more than a chord support at most points, but
now and then rises into great delineative power. The
method is one of selection until only the essentials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
remain. Each unit of expression which Sibelius has
here used is ideally fitted for its purpose. Moreover,
the song, though free in the extreme, has a close structure
which is entirely convincing. The originality of
this song should ultimately make a deep impression
on current song-writing.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In latter-day England song-writing has risen to a
dignity and importance which it had not possessed since
the time of Purcell. With Arthur Goring-Thomas,
whom we have already mentioned, a new note of artistic
sincerity entered the art. This was continued by
an unusually talented man, Arthur Somervell (born
1863), who has composed some of the best song cycles
of recent times. Somervell is by no means a radical
in his method. But his lyric sense is keen and his invention
fertile. His cycle from Tennyson’s ‘Maud’ attains
rare fidelity and tragic intensity. Among his
other numerous songs are the two cycles, ‘A Shropshire
Lad’ and ‘James Lee’s Wife,’ the latter scored for orchestral
accompaniment. These both show his happy
invention and his high musicianship. A song-writer
who has gained a much more glittering reputation less
deservedly is Edward Elgar, whom people regard for
some reason as the chief representative of modern English
song. As a matter of fact, Elgar’s song output has
been slight and has not pretended to show the best
he was capable of (as Reger did attempt to show in <em>his</em>
songs). There is little of Elgar’s forceful musicianship
which comes across to us in these songs. The ‘Sea
Pictures’ have made their effect chiefly through the
effective orchestration which their composer provided
for them. Considered as independent music, they are
inferior and somewhat conventional. The best is probably
‘Where Coral Lies.’ ‘The Swimmer’ will serve to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
suggest Elgar’s descriptive style. The conventional, in
fact, hangs over most of Elgar’s songs. The one which
notably escapes it is the beautiful lyric, ‘My Love Lives
in a Northern Land,’ which is worthy to be signed by
a first-class musician. Of the others we may mention
‘Queen Mary’s Song,’ which, with its accompaniment
in imitation of a lute, is effective in concert; ‘Through
the Long Days,’ The Shepherd’s Song,’ and The Pipes
of Pan.’</p>

<p>Granville Bantock (born 1868) may justly be called a
radical modern composer, whereas Elgar has much of
the classical reserve about him. Bantock’s very great
ability and learning sometimes produce rather chaotic
results, the more so because his output is unusually
great. But frequently it produces results that are altogether
admirable. To singers he is known chiefly
through his ‘Songs of the East.’ These are published as
cycles, as follows: Songs of Egypt, Songs of India,
Songs of Persia, Songs of the Seraglio, Five ‘Ghazels
of Hafiz,’ lyrics from ‘Ferishtah’s Fancies,’ Songs of
China, and Songs of Japan. The exoticism of these
many songs is rarely genuine and Bantock’s facile technique
extends over them all to make them seem rather
too much alike for the good of his reputation. But the
<em>effect</em> of exoticism is frequently attained with rare skill
and the musical standard is kept far higher than is
usual in this class of music. Bantock’s powerful technique,
which is obviously influenced by Richard
Strauss, is to be studied to advantage in many of these
songs, especially the more pretentious ones. From the
Songs of Egypt we should mention the majestic ‘Invocation
to the Nile,’ the mystical song ‘The Unutterable’;
and the poignant ‘Lament of Isis.’ Of the Hindoo songs
that of the Nautch girl is ever memorable for its effect
of fierce physical motion. The songs from Persia include
two of high quality, the ‘Drinking Song’ and the
‘Hymn of the Ghebers.’ Let us further pick out, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
among the best, the Persian Love Song from the ‘Songs
of the Seraglio’; and the ‘Shah Abbas’ and ‘Mahirab
Shah’ from ‘Ferishtah’s Fancies,’ the last remarkable
for its expression of physical pain. The songs of China
and Japan are in no way unusual. Nor are the six
Jester Songs, though they sometimes catch the joy of
life in engaging fashion. But Bantock has one very
ambitious work, the cycle of fragments from Sappho,
which is sufficient to put him in the front rank. It is
hard to describe the richness of the technique he has
lavished on this work. We should find it difficult to
name anything similar to it in its peculiar emotional
intensity. The best that Bantock has to show of his art
(his instrumentation aside) is all to be found in this
remarkable group of songs. Every one of them is admirable,
as is also the very long introduction. But one
remembers especially the opening number, the ‘Hymn
to Aphrodite,’ dramatic and passionate; the painfully
beautiful song, ‘The Moon Has Set’; the masterful description
of ‘Peer of the Gods’; and the profuse musical
richness of ‘In a Dream I Spake.’ Possibly these songs
will in later years be judged too pretentious. But while
the judgment is still unmade we must regard with the
highest respect the musician who has done this thing in
the musical conditions that have prevailed in England.</p>

<p>It only remains to speak of the most radical of the
young English composers, Cyril Scott (born 1874).
He broke away completely from the traditional English
style, founded on conventional church music, and embraced
the ‘atmospheric’ manner of the modern Frenchmen.
In this style he has displayed great energy and
no small amount of inventiveness. It remains to be seen
whether he can make his influence permanently felt
in music. His songs well exemplify the general style
of his music. The best are ‘Lovely Kind and Kindly
Loving’ and ‘Why so Pale and Wan,’ both from opus
55. Others which should be mentioned are ‘My Captain’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
(to Walt Whitman’s words), ‘A Reflection,’ and
‘Afterday.’ The song writing of the modern English
school has not yet gathered body. It is only beginning
to make itself felt beyond the seas. But it has already
shown so much vigor and independence that we may
justly look for abundant and fine results from it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX<br>
<small>THE FRENCH-CANADIAN FOLK-SONG</small></h2>


<p>The songs of the French Canadians, which show considerable
originality, are in part transplanted from
France, modified and localized in the natural course of
popular music. But a considerable part are indigenous,
with a history dating back, possibly, more than two
centuries. They are all, of course, made in imitation
of the parent stock, but in many instances they have
taken on a new character, befitting the wild and uncouth
environment in which they were composed. In
some instances they show model characteristics, as
in the <em>Mon Cri Cra, Tir’ la Liretta</em>, sung by the boatmen
on the Red River. This old song shows scarcely
any traces of the omnipresent influence of the court
of Louis XIV. Other songs bear the marks of the
French priests, through whose hands they passed on
their way to the Canadian natives, Indians or Frenchmen.
Such a song is <em>Jesos Ahatonhia</em>, the music of
which was evidently an ecclesiastical melody with a
strong modal character indicating its great age. But
on the whole the refined and graceful influence of
French civilization is strongly marked in the Canadian
songs, even when these songs originated in the New
World. The one department in which they are supreme
is that of playful humor—not the humor of the
old English songs, which is somewhat bumptious and
muscular, but a more delicate humor, into which the
singer enters from pure effervescence of human sympathy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
and childlike playfulness. We must range a
long way through folk-song literature before we
find a song of this sort to equal ‘The White Duck,’ or
‘I Hear a Mill Go Tick-Tack.’ A provocative playfulness
sings in the words of ‘My Faithful Bottle,’ ‘The
Lost Chance,’ and the inimitable ‘When Returning from
Varennes,’ with its continuous refrain, <em>Cach’ton joli bas
de laine</em>. The spirit of Gascony, famous home of the
practical joke, is in the ‘Song of Lies,’ in which the
singer turns the world topsy-turvy and hopes to be
hung if a single word he says is true. The sentimental
note is not so often struck, but we find it charmingly
in such occasional songs as ‘The Traveller’s Return,’
and ‘From Yonder on the Mountains.’</p>

<p>Gagnon’s collection, made in 1865 (the earliest of
all), contains a number of gentle and lovely airs, such
as <em>C’est la belle française</em>. We may also notice in this
book a number which have been transported from
France and forgotten in the home country while they
lived and flourished under their foster mother. Such
a song is <em>Dans les Prisons de Nantes</em>. <em>Mon Per’ n’avait
fille que moi</em> is one of the most interesting examples
of the old modal style. The Canadian songs are peculiarly
addicted to the use of the refrain. This device,
which is always a mark of unsophisticated playfulness,
is relied upon to such an extent that one
would call it excessive if the high spirits of the music
and words did not carry the little game through to
complete success. As so often happens, the refrain
frequently has nothing whatever to do with the sense
of the text. The primitive innocence of the mind is
absolutely demanded of any singer who attempts, for
instance, ‘The White Duck.’ On the whole, the Canadian
songs, though very limited in range, can show
a few types of folk-expression managed with such
consummate art that they deserve a place in the folk-literature
of the world.</p>
